But sometimes there are situations where imperative actions are necessary.\n\nRefs in React provides a way to access the React elements (or DOM nodes) created in the render() method.\n\nWhen parent components need to interact with children components, we typically use props However, in some cases we might need to modify a child without re-rendering it with new props. That's when refs get the spotlight.\nWhen Should I use Refs?\n\nWe advise to use refs in the following situations:\n\n    Integrating with third-party DOM libraries.\n    Triggering imperative animations.\n    Managing focus, text selection, or media playback.\n\nSo once we've determined that we really should be using refs, how do we use them?\nUsing Refs in React\n\nThere are various ways in which you can use refs:\n\n    React.createRef()\n    Callback refs\n    String refs (legacy)\n    Forwarding refs\n",

React components can be defined by subclassing React.Component or React.PureComponent as per react official doc.\n\n\nFunctional Components\n\n    A Functional component is the simplest way to define a component in ReactJs, itu2019s a simple javascript function which returns a React element. Functional components are also known as stateless components.\n\n\nClass Components\n\n    A Class components are ES6 classes based Components. A component which provide more features to deal with codes. It also receives props like function components and is able to define its own states.\n    Each component in react has several life-cycle methods, which are being used from time to time.\n\n\nPure Component\n\n    As per Reacts official documentation: React.PureComponent is similar to React.Component. The difference between them is that React.Component doesnu2019t implement shouldComponentUpdate(), but React.PureComponent implements it with a shallow prop and state comparison.\n\n    If your React componentu2019s render() function renders the same result given the same props and state, you can use React.PureComponent for a performance boost in some cases.\n",

          "answer":"Below is a snipet from:\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/react/react_lifecycle.asp\n\nEach component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases.\n\nThe three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.\n\n\nMounting\n\nMounting means putting elements into the DOM.\n\nReact has four built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting a component:\n\n    constructor()\n    getDerivedStateFromProps()\n    render()\n    componentDidMount()\n\nThe render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you define them.\n\n\n\nUpdating\n\nThe next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is updated.\n\nA component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's state or props.\n\nReact has five built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when a component is updated:\n\n    getDerivedStateFromProps()\n    shouldComponentUpdate()\n    render()\n    getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()\n    componentDidUpdate()\n\nThe render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you define them.\n\n\nUnmounting\n\nThe next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is removed from the DOM, or unmounting as React likes to call it.\n\nReact has only one built-in method that gets called when a component is unmounted:\n\n    componentWillUnmount()\n\ncomponentWillUnmount\n\nThe componentWillUnmount method is called when the component is about to be removed from the DOM.\n\n\n\n\nBelow is more detail on how these are used from:\nhttps://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html\n\nIn applications with many components, itu2019s very important to free up resources taken by the components when they are destroyed.\n\nWe want to set up a timer whenever the Clock is rendered to the DOM for the first time. This is called u201cmountingu201d in React.\n\nWe also want to clear that timer whenever the DOM produced by the Clock is removed. This is called u201cunmountingu201d in React.\n\nWe can declare special methods on the component class to run some code when a component mounts and unmounts:\n\nclass Clock extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {date: new Date()};\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {  }\n  componentWillUnmount() {  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>\n        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nThese methods are called u201clifecycle methodsu201d.\n\nThe componentDidMount() method runs after the component output has been rendered to the DOM. This is a good place to set up a timer:\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.timerID = setInterval(      () => this.tick(),      1000    );  }\n\nNote how we save the timer ID right on this (this.timerID).\n\nWhile this.props is set up by React itself and this.state has a special meaning, you are free to add additional fields to the class manually if you need to store something that doesnu2019t participate in the data flow (like a timer ID).\n\nWe will tear down the timer in the componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method:\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    clearInterval(this.timerID);  }",

          "answer":"This excerpt comes from an answer by Crescent Fresh on stackoverflow.com:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/1688293\n\nEvent bubbling provides the foundation for event delegation in \nbrowsers. Now you can bind an event handler to a single parent element, \nand that handler will get executed whenever the event occurs on any of its child nodes (and any of their children in turn). This is event delegation. Here's an example of it in practice\n\n\n<ul onclick=\"alert(event.type + '!')\">\n    <li>One</li>\n    <li>Two</li>\n    <li>Three</li>\n</ul>\n\n\nWith that example if you were to click on any of the child \n<li>\n nodes, you would see an alert of \n\"click!\"\n, even though there is no click handler bound to the \n<li>\n you clicked on. If we bound \nonclick=\"...\"\n to each \n<li>\n you would get the same effect.\n\n\nSo what's the benefit?\n\n\nImagine you now have a need to dynamically add new \n<li>\n items to the above list via DOM manipulation:\n\n\nvar newLi = document.createElement('li');\nnewLi.innerHTML = 'Four';\nmyUL.appendChild(newLi);\n\n\nWithout using event delegation you would have to \"rebind\" the \n\"onclick\"\n event handler to the new \n<li>\n element, in order for it to act the same way as its siblings. With event delegation you don't need to do anything. Just add the new \n<li>\n to the list and you're done.\n\n\nThis is absolutely fantastic for web apps with event handlers bound \nto many elements, where new elements are dynamically created and/or \nremoved in the DOM. With event delegation the number of event bindings \ncan be drastically decreased by moving them to a common parent element, \nand code that dynamically creates new elements on the fly can be \ndecoupled from the logic of binding their event handlers.\n\n",

This will tell us if one is really just a variable that was passed a reference to the original object, like with: const var1 = obj1; This is only a reference, so Object.is(var1, obj1) will equal true. If so, the values will always be identical.\n\nComparing unique objects can be a little more involved. There is a loose approach and a more strict approach. \n\nWe can test the number of entries in each, as a different number of entries would indicate they are different. We can do this by checking if one has more keys than the other using Object.keys().length or Object.getOwnPropertyNames().length.\nWhen iterating through the objects, we must also account for the possibility of nested arrays and/or objects. These might even go many levels deep.\n\nOne way is to turn both objects into strings using JSON.stringify() and then compare the strings. This will ONLY work if we know the keys will always be IN THE SAME ORDER. When using this method, any variance, like a key being in a different place, will cause the comparison to fail even though the values might be identical.\n\nA more strict approach is to iterate through each object and check the key-value pair against the other. This will work even if the keys are not in the same order. \n\n\nconst user1 = {\n  first: 'Lando',\n  last: 'Calrissian'\n};\nconst user2 = {\n  first: 'Lando',\n  last: 'Calrissian'\n};\n\n\n// Direct comparison\nconsole.log(user1 === user2);  // false\n\n// Stringify process\nconst stringObj1 = JSON.stringify(user1);\nconst stringObj2 = JSON.stringify(user2);\n\nconsole.log(typeof stringObj1);  // string\nconsole.log(stringObj1 === stringObj2);  // true\n\n\n\n// Iterating process possibiltiy\nfunction isSameObject (obj1, obj2) {\n  const props1 = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj1);\n  const props2 = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj2);\n\n  if (props1.length !== props2.length) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < props1.length; i++) {\n    const property = props1[i];\n\n    if (props1[property] !== props2[property]) {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return true;\n}\n\nconsole.log(isSameObject(user1, user2));  // true",

It is simply and only about making sure we have a clear and accurate foundation to ensure every step after this is heading towards a solution. \n\n\t\tFor example, \"It crashes\" isn't what we need to know. We need to know something more like:\n\n\t\t\"When I was using Chrome and had the app open for about five minutes and I had just done these actions and then it it started stuttering for about ten seconds and then it froze. After about a minute I saw an error popup that said this. This has happened twice before basically the same way.\"\n\n\t\tAnd the above can still just be the beginning of defining the problem. We need to end of with as much info as we can so we know where to start drilling down.\n\n\n\t2. Narrow the scope: Next we want to take our drill-down points and begin to narrow to as small an area or piece of code as we can. \n\n\t\tFor this, we start with any error that we uncovered from the first step. From there, the browser dev tools are usually a good place to go. Chrome Dev Tools' Lighthouse tool helpful if we have a slow-load issue. The Network tab in Chrome or Firefox dev tools is very helpful. The Performance tab is outstanding when trying to pinpoint interaction issues, like choppy animations and we will almost always be hitting the Console and breakpoints if debugging JavaScript issues. For HTML and CSS, the Inspector is going to get opened.\n\n\t\t\tMore tools: If we are working in a framework or library, there might be a browser extension or other tools to help us with this narrowing process.\n\n\t\t\tOne more note: Don't think there is only console.log available. console.table and many others can be a huge help.\n. \n\n\t3. Isolate: Once we gained an understanding of the specific symptoms and then narrowed the scope of our focus, we can now address these specific areas of code. Again dev tools Debugger, the Performance tool and other can help us fully isolate the specific block or lines of code.\n\n\t\tIf need be, it can help to isolate specific blocks of code in a separate editor, perhaps even an online editor like repl.it, codepen.io or jsbin.com. This can help zero-in on specific problems in the code.\n\t\tAlong the same line of thinking, commenting out blocks of code and/or temporarily inserting new simplified code can help ensure we have properly identified the problem area.\n\n\t4. Fix: By this point, we have arrived at the problem pieces of code. Now, we just need to correct the issue.\n\n\t5. Test...a lot: We have not fixed the problem at this point. We have only written the code that we think will correct the issue. Test. Test. Test again. At that point, we have fixed the issue.\n",

          "answer":"The fundamental principles of design are:\n\nBALANCEu200au2014u200aBalance in design is similar to balance in physics. A large shape close to the center can be balanced by a small shape close to the edge. Balance provides stability and structure to a design. Itu2019s the weight distributed in the design by the placement of your elements.\n\nPROPORTION & PROXIMITYu200au2014u200aProportion and proximity create a relationship between elements. It provides a focal point. Proximity doesnu2019t mean that elements have to be placed together, it means they should be visually connected in some way.\n\nALIGNMENTu200au2014u200aAllows us to create order and organization. Aligning elements allows them to create a visual connection with each other.\n\nREPETITIONu200au2014u200aRepetition strengthens a design by tying together individual elements. It helps to create association and consistency. Repetition can create rhythm (a feeling of organized movement).\n\nRHYTHM - The spaces between repeating elements can cause a sense of rhythm to form, similar to the way the space between notes in a musical composition create a rhythm. There are five basic types of visual rhythm that designers can create: random, regular, alternating, flowing, and progressive.\n\nWHITE SPACE - As already mentioned in the rhythm section above, white space is part of a design. White space, or u201cnegative spaceu201d it is sometimes called, is the areas of a design that are effectively, empty. While empty, these still provide impact and affect the elements around as well as the effectiveness of a design.\n\nPATTERN - Patterns are the repetition of multiple design elements working together. Wallpaper patterns are a common example of patterns. In design, patterns can also refer to set standards like, for example, top navigation is a common design pattern.\n\nCONTRASTu200au2014u200aContrast is the juxtaposition of opposing elements (opposite colors on the color wheel, or value light/dark, or directionu200au2014u200ahorizontal/vertical). Contrast allows us to emphasize or highlight key elements in your design.\n\nSPACEu200au2014u200aSpace in art refers to the distance or area between, around, above, below, or within elements. Both positive and negative space are important factors to be considered in every design.\n\nEMPHASIS - Emphasis deals with the parts of a design that are meant to stand out. Emphasis can also be used to reduce the impact of certain information. This is most apparent in instances where u201cfine printu201d is used for ancillary information in a design.\n\nHIERARCHY - Hierarchy relates to how well content can be processed by people using a website. It refers to the importance of elements within a design. The most important elements (or content) should appear to be the most important. This relates to emphasis, but is not the same. Hierarchy is the order in with things should appear important. Hierarchy is most easily illustrated through the use of titles and headings in a design. The title of a page should be given the most importance, and therefore should be immediately recognizable as the most important element on a page. Headings and subheadings should be formatted in a way that shows their importance in relation to each other as well as in relation to the title and body copy.\n\n\n",

          "answer":" There are two ways to use LESS. You can create a LESS file and convert it on-demand using a Javascript file or you can pre-compile it and use the resulting CSS file. \n\nUsing The LESS Javascript File\n\nFirst of all head down to the LESS website and grab the Javascript file. Once you have it, all you need to do is link it to your page like any other Javascript file.\n\t\n script src=\"less.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"> /script\n\nNext, create a file with the .less extension and link it to your page with the code below:\n\t\n<link rel=\"stylesheet/less\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"style.less\">\n\nMake sure that you link your LESS file before the Javascript file.\n\nOnce you have this setup you can paste your existing CSS code into the LESS file or just write a few new rules - it should work just like plain ol' CSS.\n\n\n\nCompiling The LESS File\n\nWhile this is a bit more tedious, in some scenarios this is preferred. LESS works by taking all the LESS code you write and converting it to CSS on the fly. Instead of doing this on demand we can convert our LESS file, save the CSS output and use that instead of doing the on-demand conversion on each page load.\n\nIf you're a Mac user you can use LESS.app, a small application which can detect all your LESS files automatically and whenever you save them it will convert them to a CSS file with the same name. This allows you to keep on linking to your CSS file on your pages while still utilizing the potential of LESS.\n\nIf you're on Windows you can use Winless which works in much the same way.\n\nIf you prefer command-line tools you can use the Node Package Manager (NPM) to install LESS. Some documentation is available on the LESS website. You can also grab the code directly from the Github repository. \n\n\nThere is more to this article at:\nhttps://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/get-into-less-the-programmable-stylesheet-language--webdesign-5216",

          "answer":"\nWhile many groups will have their own version, the basics will be similar.\n\nBased on the Agile Manifesto: http://agilemanifesto.org/\n\nHere it is:\n_______________________________\nManifesto for Agile Software Development\n\n\tWe are uncovering better ways of developing\n\tsoftware by doing it and helping others do it.\n\tThrough this work we have come to value:\n\n\tIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools\n\n\tWorking software over comprehensive documentation\n\n\tCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation\n\n\tResponding to change over following a plan\n\n\tThat is, while there is value in the items on\n\tthe right, we value the items on the left more.\n_______________________________\n\n\nScrum is a common framework used to achieve the principles in the Agile Manifesto.\n\nHere is a good bit of detail on all of the above: https://blog.trello.com/beginners-guide-scrum-and-agile-project-management\n\nBelow is an excerpt from that good article that gives us the basics:\n_______________________________\n\nu201cYou donu2019t need much to get started with Scrum,u201d says Matthew, u201cYou really just need a place to organize your thoughts, or your Backlog. That could be software like Trello, or even just a whiteboard. You need the different roles, like the Product Owner and the Scrum Master. The actual tools you need are not as big as the roles involved.u201d\n\nLetu2019s break down the pieces and parts that make Scrum happen:\n\n    Scrum starts with a Product Owner. This is the person who represents the final useru2019s best interest, and has the authority to say what goes into the final product.\n\n    That Product Owner is in charge of making the Backlog, a list of tasks and requirements the final product needs. Hereu2019s an important part: The backlog MUST be prioritized. Thatu2019s the job of the Product Owner. \n        If I were using Scrum to design a car, items like u201cMust have an engineu201d would be near the top of my prioritized list, because the car canu2019t work without it. u201cMust be painted redu201d would be lower on my priority list; it might still be important to me, but itu2019s not a requirement for the car to run.\n\n    Next up is the Sprint. A Sprint is a predetermined time frame within which the team completes sets of tasks from the Backlog. The length of time depends on the needs of the team, but two weeks is pretty typical.\n\n    Teams meet every day to give progress updates in the Daily Scrum. Many people also call these u201cDaily Stand-Ups.u201d\n\n    Each Sprint ends with a review, or Retrospective, where the team reviews their work and discusses ways to improve the next Sprint.\n\nAs you can see, thereu2019s not really any special equipment or training you need to get started. The hardest part is learning the lingo, and staying true to the rules and guidelines that make Scrum work.\n\t_______________________________\n\n\n\tAnd implementing this? The article continues:\n\n\t_______________________________\n\tHere are some basic steps to get started:\n\n    Download and print the PDF version of the official Scrum Guide: Read it on your commute or during your lunch break with a highlighter in hand. Highlight the phrases and roles that are new to you and start working on memorizing what each one means.\n\n    Pick your roles: You need a Product Owner (speaks for the user, final say in what the project needs), a Scrum Master (helps the team move along based on the principles of Scrum), and team members. Remember, thereu2019s no room for egos in Scrum. Scrum runs on a u201cservant leaderu201d model.\n\n    Create your product Backlog: The Backlog is where you list out everything the project needs, ordered by importance. Keep in mind that the Backlog is never complete. As the project takes shape and new needs emerge, you will add to this. The Product Owner takes primarily responsible for this.\n\n    Plan your Sprint: Next, itu2019s time to pick tasks from the backlog to be completed in your first Sprint. Sprintu2019s are time-limited. You can decide a time length that works for you, but they are always less than one month. During the Sprint Planning, the team decides what tasks to include in this Sprint and who will be responsible for them.\n\n    Get to work! Time to start working on that Sprint! Team members work on their tasks, and everybody checks in on their progress at the Daily Scrum Meeting. This meeting lasts no more than 15-minutes and answers three questions: What did you work on yesterday? What will you work on today? Is there anything blocking your work today that you need help with?\n\n    Review your work: At the end of the Sprint, the team reviews the work accomplished and presents their completed tasks.\n\n    Review your process: During the Retrospective meeting, youu2019ll review how the actual work process went and plan ways you can improve your work and be more efficient next time.\n\n    Repeat! With your first Sprint complete, itu2019s time to start over again. Pick more tasks from the Backlog and repeat the process.\n\t_______________________________\n\n\nA certificate is not necessary, but can be a stand-out item on a resume.

          "answer":"Here are a few snippets from:\nhttps://dzone.com/articles/client-side-vs-server-side-rendering-what-to-choos\n\n\nClient-Side Rendering\n\nClient-side rendering or CSR is a different approach to how the web page is processed for display in the browser. In the CSR, the burden of compiling dynamic content and generating HTML for them is transferred to the client's browser.\n\nThis approach is powered with JavaScript frameworks and libraries like ReactJS, VueJS, and Angular. The normal flow of web page rendering for a client-side rendering scenario follows these steps:\n\n    The user sends a request to a website (usually via a browser).\n    Instead of a server, a CDN (Content Delivery Network) can be used to serve static HTML, CSS, and supporting files to the user.\n    The browser downloads the HTML and then the JS. Meanwhile, the user sees a loading symbol.\n    After the browser fetches the JS, it makes API requests via AJAX to fetch the dynamic content and processes it to render the final content.\n    After the server responds, the final content is rendered using DOM processing in the client's browser.\n\n\n\n\nServer-Side Rendering\n\nServer-side rendering or SSR is the conventional way of rendering web pages on the browser. As discussed above, the traditional way of rendering dynamic web content follows the below steps:\n\n    The user sends a request to a website (usually via a browser)\n    The server checks the resource, compiles and prepares the HTML content after traversing through server-side scripts lying within the page.\n    This compiled HTML is sent to the clientu2019s browser for further rendering and display.\n    The browser downloads the HTML and makes the site visible to the end-user\n    The browser then downloads the Javascript (JS) and as it executes the JS, it makes the page interactive\n\nServer-side rendering\nServer-side rendering\n\nIn this process, all the burden of getting the dynamic content, converting it to HTML, and sending it to the browser is on the server. Hence, this process is called server-side rendering (SSR).This responsibility of rendering the complete HTML in advance comes with a burden on memory and processing power on the server. This increases the page load time compared to the page load time for a static site where there is no dynamic content to render.\n\n\nWhen to Use SSR & CSR\n\nDynamic Content Loading\nMachines on the client end, however, feature limited computing power. This translates into more time required to complete content rendering. Therefore, if your site involves repeated dynamic content rendering, SSR is the better choice.\n\nWeb App UX & Site UX\nCSR works best for web apps because it can help ensure that each click doesnu2019t take too long. When it comes to websites, however, SSR fares better than CSR because it ensures the right metadata for searching engine bots. On top of that, caching mechanisms can help speed up rendering when users navigate from one page to another.\n\n\n\nBest of Both Worlds\n\nThere are frameworks that work on a hybrid approach, such as Gatsby.\n\nWhile the first page is always loaded with SSR, it caches the other pages after the load is done so the rest of the pages are pre-rendered and cached, making it feel like youu2019re using a CSR approach on the subsequent pages! Check out our website, which is also built using Gatsby.\n\n",

For example, a contextual selector (like a class, pseudo-element, etc) is less specific in comparison to the ID selector, which will cause the contextual selector to be overridden by the ID selector.\n\nc) Sort by order specified: This comes in the scenario when the two selectors are of the same weight as one that appears later in the style sheet, or in a style sheet that loads later. In this scenario, the later overrides the former.\n\nAll other styles will be overridden if the style attribute is used for inline styling.\n\nAlso, if the link element is used for external style, then it will override the imported style.",

It is important to separate concerns for multi-faceted projects like web pages.\n\n\t<h1 style=\"color: blue;\">Example</h1>\n\n- <style> tags in the documents <head> can be used to assign selectors to declarations. The browser will then link classes used on the elements in the <body> to the selectors in the <style> tag.

          "answer":"Because the first part of the question has to numbers being added together, 3 + 2, we will then have 5 + \"7\". What happens next is that JavaScript is designed to convert these two different types, a number and a string, so that both are strings. This process is called \"coercion\". Now, we have to strings being added together, \"5\" + \"7\". When two strings are added, they simply are concatenated. In this case, it forms \"57\". If we wanted to add these as numbers, we need to check and make sure each item is an actual number and not a string.\n\nMore examples\nThis is implicit coersion:\nconst total = 2 + 3 + '7';\nconsole.log(total); // 57\nconsole.log(typeof total); // string\n\nExplicit coersion:\nconsole.log(typeof String(5)); // string\nconsole.log(typeof Boolean(0)); // boolean\nconsole.log(typeof Number('4')); // number\n",

          "answer":"This is another question that is designed to make sure we know the fundamentals of CSS both in theory and in practice. CSS can often be overlooked in pursuit of more complicated functionality, but solid CSS skills are vital for the creation of anything that will touch a screen. While these type of questions can eliminate candidates that struggle, these can be great opportunities to expand and elevate those that grasp some basic concepts well.\n\nThe Box Model refers to the rectangular or square space that an element occupies when the browser is rendering the document. The rectangle or square is called the \"box\". Every element is inside its own box. \n\nAlong with containing the element, the position, size and other properties will be set. CSS will set these properties and can include the padding, border, box-shadow, and more. \n\nEach box is essentially made up of four parts: \"content area\", \"margin area\", \"padding area\" and \"border area\". \n\nThe content area has the item meant to be displayed. The margin area is just the minimum distance from the box to any other box around it while the padding area is the distance between the box and the content. The border area is just the line between the margin and padding areas. \n\nThe dimensions of the border area become the border-box. The dimensions of the content area become the content-box. This is important to understand as the box-sizing property settings can have dramatic affects on a document's layout. The default behavior is to treat the size of a box by its content-box. This means that padding and margin, both of which are outside of the content-box, are not considered when calculating the total width and height of an element. This is useful when we want to preserve the content width and potion it based on the content. In some situations this can cause problems, like an element extending past its parent's borders. For these cases, we can use the border-box dimensions to ensure all of the properties will be factored into the elements size and positioning.\n",

          "answer":"This type of question might be general like the first one or specific like the second. In either case, it is good to have a firm understanding of a set of industry-accepted best practices. \n\nThe SOLID principles are a good place to start.Here is a descriptive excerpt from Wikipedia:\n\"SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable.\"\n\n\"The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by American software engineer and instructor Robert C. Martin. Though they apply to any object-oriented design, the SOLID principles can also form a core philosophy for methodologies such as agile development or adaptive software development.\"\n\nHere are the five core principles:\n\tSingle-responsibility principle - Every class, module or function should be responsible for only one part of the app's functionality. That responsibility should be narrow. the class, module or function should completely handle that responsibility within.\n\n\t\tOne example of this Single-responsibility principle is a function that handles displaying sports scores. So, it gathers the content and then creates the HTML. One job is substance, the content, and the other is more cosmetic, the HTML. That means the function covers two responsibilities. Single-Responsibility says these should be two separate functions.\n\n\tOpenu2013closed principle - Classes, modules and functions should be open for extension, but closed for modification. This basically means that we should plan ahead for the need to add new functionality without needing to rewrite the original,\n\n\tFor example, here, we can use this to shop for a car.\n\n\tclass CarShopping {\n\t  // Some other helper functions u2026\n\n\t  carsAvailable() {\n\n\t  \tconst response = \"Data from an API.\"\n\t    return response;\n\t  }\n\n\t  totalCostCalculator() {\n\t  \t//...code\n\t  }\n\t //...other helpful functionality\n\t}\n\n\tThis will work for a car search, but if we later decide to also shop for a utility truck or a boat? We would need to go back and directly add that functionality. This is modifying the class. Instead we can just plan ahead a bit and make it so we can extend the core functionality.\n\n\tclass vehicleShopping {\n\n\t  financingCalculator() {\n\t  \t//...code\n\t  }\n\n\t //...other helpful functionality\n\t}\n\n\n\tclass CarShopping extends vehicleShopping{\n\n\t  carsAvailable() {\n\n\t  \tconst response = \"Data from an API.\"\n\t    return response;\n\t  }\n\n\t}\n\n\tclass TruckShopping extends vehicleShopping{\n\n\t  trucksAvailable() {\n\n\t  \tconst response = \"Data from an API.\"\n\t    return response;\n\t  }\n\n\t}\n\n\tclass BoatShopping extends vehicleShopping{\n\n\t  trucksAvailable() {\n\n\t  \tconst response = \"Data from an API.\"\n\t    return response;\n\t  }\n\n\t}\n\n\n\n\tLiskov substitution principle - Objects should be replaceable with instances without altering the use (see also design by contract). Basically, if we make an instance, it should be able to be used like any other related instance.\n\n\t\tA great example here is Maysara Alhindi's StackOverflow example here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/44913313\n\n\t\tpublic class Bird{\n\t\t    public void fly(){}\n\t\t}\n\t\tpublic class Duck extends Bird{}\n\n\n\t\tThe duck can fly because of it is a bird, but what about this:\n\n\n\t\tpublic class Ostrich extends Bird{}\n\n\n\t\tAn ostrich is a bird, But it can't fly, Ostrich class is a subtype of class Bird, But it can't use the fly method, that means that we are breaking LSP principle.\n\t\t\n\t\tHere is a better way:\n\n\t\tpublic class Bird{\n\t\t}\n\t\tpublic class FlyingBirds extends Bird{\n\t\t    public void fly(){}\n\t\t}\n\t\tpublic class Duck extends FlyingBirds{}\n\t\tpublic class Ostrich extends Bird{} \n\n\n\n\tInterface segregation principle - This is basically the Single-Responsibility principle, but applied to an interfaces. JavaScript does not have official interfaces like other programming languages, but how we access an object can be considered an interface. The goal here is just to make sure the methods on an object are sing-purposed. \n\n\n\tDependency inversion principle - For JavaScript, the goal here is to make sure high level modules don't depend upon low level modules. Like ISP above, examples for this are always converted to TypeScrupt because the interface language feature there, so it is not very helpful for JavaScript. In general, the goal is to make sure that we don't have one module or class that can not work because it requires another module or class. This can be especially bad if there is a chain of dependencies like this.\n\n\tThis is a good read on the subject: https://carstenbehrens.com/dependency-inversion-principle%20copy/\n\n",

Other numeronyms you may be familiar with include: i18n (internationalization), P2P (peer to peer), WWII (World War 2), etc.\n\nThe word accessibility has different meanings in different contexts. On the internet, the use of the term a11y helps to identify content related specifically to digital accessibility. For example, it is often used as a Twitter hashtag by digital accessibility practitioners.\n\n\nMaking things accessible translates to better opportunities, as it means more people can use them. Accessible digital experiences also remove barriers. This is incredibly important for things like employment, an area where disabled people have been historically faced discrimination.\n\nIn addition, recent researchhas revealed that there are billions of dollars in potential revenue if accessibility needs are accommodated. For example, the keyboard present with every desktop and laptop computer, tablet, and smartphone are \nderived from the Hansen Writing Ball, assistive technology invented in the early 1800s.",

For example, if we declare a variable to be an integer and then try to pass in \"Hello!\", we will get an error.\n\nIn dynamically typed languages,like JavaScript, we do not declare any specific type for a variable. we can pass in the number 1 and then later pass in \"Hello!\" and we will be able to do so, though the program might have trouble if it was needing a number for some processes. Ultimately, this can lead to type errors.\n\nSome developers prefer a typed language. TypeScript was created to allow one to use JavaScript, but it becomes a typed language.

          "answer":"CSS can assign a wide range of colors to elements using different notations. There are three notations as of now that are used. These are explained below:\n\nHexadecimal notation\nA color in hexadecimal string notation always begins with the character u201c#u201d. After that, the hexadecimal digits of the color code is written. The string is case-insensitive.\n\nRGB functional notation\nRGB (Red/Green/Blue) functional notation, like hexadecimal string notation, represents colors using their red, green, and blue components (as well as, optionally, an alpha channel component for opacity). However, instead of using a string, the color is defined using the CSS function RGB(). This function accepts as its input parameters the values of the red, green, and blue components and an optional fourth parameter, the value for the alpha channel.\n\nHSL functional notation\nDesigners and artists often prefer to work using the HSL (Hue/Saturation/Luminosity) color method. On the web, HSL colors are represented using HSL functional notation. The HSL() CSS function is very similar to the RGB() function in usage otherwise",

This does not mean browser compatibility is no longer a concern. \nModern browsers are much more consistent with including features, but it is still good to check with a tool like https://caniuse.com/ or MDN to make sure new features are well covered.\n\nFor most browsers, we can easily download them and test our app. But what about older versions of each browser? What about these browsers on different devices. What if we need to test on Safari, but do not have access to a Mac? There are tools like https://www.browserstack.com/ to test web apps in many different ways. Some will even monitor real users on different browsers and devices. We can even have automated routines to test these scenarios.  \n\nBeyond testing, it is important that we know well what our target audience is going to be.

          "answer":"5 Differences Between Arrow and Regular Functions\n\nIn JavaScript, you can define functions in many ways.\n\nThe first, usual way, is by using the function keyword:\n\n// Function declaration\nfunction greet(who) {\n  return `Hello, ${who}!`;\n}\n\n// Function expression\nconst greet = function(who) {\n  return `Hello, ${who}`;\n}\n\nThe function declaration and function expression Iu2019m going to reference as regular function.\n\nThe second way, available starting ES2015, is the arrow function syntax:\n\nconst greet = (who) => {\n  return `Hello, ${who}!`;\n}\n\nWhile both the regular and arrow syntaxes define functions, when would you choose one instead of another? Thatu2019s a good question.\n\n1. this value\n1.1 Regular function\n\nInside of a regular JavaScript function, this value (aka the execution context) is dynamic.\n\nThe dynamic context means that the value of this depends on how the function is invoked. In JavaScript, there are 4 ways you can invoke a regular function.\n\nDuring a simple invocation the value of this equals to the global object (or undefined if the function runs in strict mode):\n\nfunction myFunction() {\n  console.log(this);\n}\n\n// Simple invocation\nmyFunction(); // logs global object (window)\n\nDuring a method invocation the value of this is the object owning the method:\n\nconst myObject = {\n  method() {\n    console.log(this);\n  }\n};\n// Method invocation\nmyObject.method(); // logs myObject\n\nDuring an indirect invocation using myFunc.call(thisVal, arg1, ..., argN) or myFunc.apply(thisVal, [arg1, ..., argN]) the value of this equals to the first argument:\n\nfunction myFunction() {\n  console.log(this);\n}\n\nconst myContext = { value: 'A' };\n\nmyFunction.call(myContext);  // logs { value: 'A' }\nmyFunction.apply(myContext); // logs { value: 'A' }\n\nDuring a constructor invocation using new keyword this equals to the newly created instance:\n\n\nNow, in contrast with regular functions, the method defined using an arrow binds this lexically to the class instance.\n\nLetu2019s use the arrow function as a field:\n\nclass Hero {\n  constructor(heroName) {\n    this.heroName = heroName;\n  }\n\n  logName = () => {\n    console.log(this.heroName);\n  }\n}\n\nconst batman = new Hero('Batman');\nNow you can use batman.logName as a callback without any manual binding of this. The value of this inside logName() method is always the class instance:\n\nsetTimeout(batman.logName, 1000);\n// after 1 second logs \"Batman\"\n\n...to read the rest got to: \nhttps://dmitripavlutin.com/differences-between-arrow-and-regular-functions/\n",

It is positioned relative to the initial containing block established by the viewport, except when one of its ancestors has a transform, perspective, or filter property set to something other than none (see the CSS Transforms Spec), in which case that ancestor behaves as the containing block. (Note that there are browser inconsistencies with perspective and filter contributing to containing block formation.) Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left. \n\nThis value always creates a new stacking context. In printed documents, the element is placed in the same position on every page. \n\nsticky \n\nThe element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor and containing block (nearest block-level ancestor), including table-related elements, based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the position of any other elements. \n\nThis value always creates a new stacking context. Note that a sticky element \"sticks\" to its nearest ancestor that has a \"scrolling mechanism\" (created when overflow is hidden, scroll, auto, or overlay), even if that ancestor isn't the nearest actually scrolling ancestor. This effectively inhibits any \"sticky\" behavior (see the GitHub issue on W3C CSSWG). \n\n ",

For this to be true,u00a0responsive designu00a0requires a very good conceptualization of the site and a deep knowledge of the needs and wants of the end users!\n\n\n\nAdaptive Web Design\n\nAdaptive Web Design was introduced in 2011 by web designer Aaron Gustafson in his book,u00a0Adaptive Web Design: Crafting Rich Experiences With Progressive Enhancement.u00a0It is also known asu00a0progressive enhancementu00a0of a website.\n\nWhere responsive design relies on changing the design pattern to fit the real estate available to it, adaptive design hasu00a0multiple fixed layout sizes. When the siteu00a0detectsu00a0theu00a0available space, itu00a0selectsu00a0theu00a0layoutu00a0most appropriate for the screen. So, when you open a browser on the desktop, the site chooses the best layout for that desktop screen; resizing the browser hasu00a0nou00a0impact on the design.\n\nSome sites have been quick to embrace adaptive design. Amazon, USA Today, Apple, and About.com configured themselves to be mobile-optimized websites. The layout displayed on a mobile website using adaptive design may be different from the desktopu2019s version. However, this is because the designers have picked a different layout for the phoneu2019s screen rather than leaving the design to try to rearrange itself.\n\nIn adaptive design, itu2019s normal to develop six designs for the six most common screen widths; 320, 480, 760, 960, 1200, and 1600 pixels.",

          "answer":"A few basic elements of design are:    \n\n\nLINE u2013 The linear marks made with a pen or brush or the edge created when two shapes meet.    \n\n\nSHAPE u2013 A shape is a self contained defined area of geometric (squares and circles), or organic (free formed shapes or natural shapes). A positive shape automatically creates a negative shape.    \n\n\nDIRECTION u2013 All lines have direction u2013 Horizontal, Vertical or Oblique. Horizontal suggests calmness, stability and tranquility. Vertical gives a feeling of balance, formality and alertness. Oblique suggests movement and action    \n\n\nSIZE u2013 Size is simply the relationship of the area occupied by one shape to that of another.    \n\n\nTEXTURE u2013 Texture is the surface quality of a shape u2013 rough, smooth, soft hard glossy etc.    \n\n\nCOLOR u2013 Color is light reflected off objects. Color has three main characteristics: hue or its name (red, green, blue, etc.), value (how light or dark it is), and intensity (how bright or dull it is).",

Browser cookies are available and used basically the same way. It is important to plan this out well. It is easy for this to become very complex and hard to maintain.\n\nWhile global variables can work to maintain State, use of these is strongly discouraged.

That would be best.\n\nHow did they handle the stars? Pseudo elements would be a good candidate there. Did they use unicode? Icon font?\n\nDid they catch the subtle text-shadow?\n\nHow did they split the background in the main part of the button? a linear-gradient with no fade would be a good technique there.

          "answer":"A CSS preprocessor is a program that lets you generate CSS from the preprocessoru2019s own unique syntax. There are many CSS preprocessors to choose from, however, most CSS preprocessors will add some features that donu2019t exist in pure CSS, such as mixin, nesting selector, inheritance selector, and so on. These features make the CSS structure more readable and easier to maintain.\n\nThe usage depends on the type of project but the following advantages/disadvantages come with a preprocessor.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nCSS is made more maintainable.\nEasy to write nested selectors.\nVariables for consistent theming. Can share theme files across different projects.\nMixins to generate repeated CSS.\nSass features like loops, lists, and maps can make configuration easier and less verbose.\nSplitting your code into multiple files. CSS files can be split up too but doing so will require an HTTP request to download each CSS file.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nRequires tools for preprocessing. Re-compilation time can be slow.\nNot writing currently and potentially usable CSS. For example, by using something likeu00a0postcss-loaderu00a0withu00a0webpack, you can write potentially future-compatible CSS, allowing you to use things like CSS variables instead of Sass variables. Thus, youu2019re learning new skills that could pay off if/when they become standardized.\n\nSelecting a preprocessor really boils down to preference, and it can be revealing to see how a particular developer might decide to use one over the other for your project.",

This makes it possible to have one rule set affect any number of elements and changes to that rule set can affect them all. Classes are less specific to an element, so if a conflicting declaration exists in a rule set that has an ID, the declaration in the rule set with the ID will override the declaration with only a class.

Our goal is to show that we not only have dealt with conflict but that we have thought about it and worked through the difficult aspects. The worst thing we can do is not have an answer, or say we have never encountered any conflict. That is not realistic and it leaves the question wide open as to what they can expect from us if we encounter conflict while working there. Even a story about how we handled conflict poorly is fine, as long as we can talk clearly about how we thought and felt at the time and how we eventually learned how to handle it all better. \n\nTo put it simply:\n\tBe human. \n\tShow growth. \n\tShow thought. \n\tShow intent to understand others, even if they are acting poorly. \n\tShow a desire to explore the finer points of human interaction.\n\tShow that all of the above maters enough to have carefully thought about it.\n",

CSS2 was released in 1998 with added styles for other media types so that it can be used for page layout designing. CSS3 was released in 1999 and presentation-style properties were added in it that allows you to build a presentation from documents.\n\nUnlike CSS2, which was comprised of a single document, CSS3 has its specifications divided into many individual modules, which makes CSS3 a whole lot easier to handle.\n\nWith CSS3, the designers can now use special fonts, like those available in Google Fonts and Typecast. Earlier, with CSS and CSS2, designers could only use u201cweb-safe fontsu201d for being 100% sure to use fonts that would always display the same on every machine.\n\nWhile CSS and CSS2 had u2018simple selectorsu2019, CSS3 calls the components as u2018a sequence of simple selectorsu2019.\n\nCSS3 came up with some key web design considerations like rounded borders that help in rounding up the borders without any hassle. This turned out to be a huge plus point for developers who were struggling with initial versions of CSS borders.\n\nCSS3 has the capability to split text sections into multiple columns so that it can be read like a newspaper. In CSS2, the developers had difficulty because the standard was not equipped with automatically breaking the text so that it fits within a box.\n\n",

          "answer":"This comes from a nice article describing what callbacks are:\nhttps://codeburst.io/javascript-what-the-heck-is-a-callback-aba4da2deced\n\nWhat is a Callback?\n\nSimply put: A callback is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing u2014 hence the name u2018call backu2019.\n\nMore complexly put: In JavaScript, functions are objects. Because of this, functions can take functions as arguments, and can be returned by other functions. Functions that do this are called higher-order functions. Any function that is passed as an argument is called a callback function.\n\nAn aexample:\nfunction first(){\n  // Simulate a code delay\n  setTimeout( function(){\n    console.log(1);\n  }, 500 );\n}function second(){\n  console.log(2);\n}first();\nsecond();\n\n\nfirst();\nsecond();\n// 2\n// 1\n\n\nAnd from a site called callbackhell.com:\n\nWhat is \"callback hell\"?\n\nAsynchronous JavaScript, or JavaScript that uses callbacks, is hard to get right intuitively. A lot of code ends up looking like this:\n\nfs.readdir(source, function (err, files) {\n  if (err) {\n    console.log('Error finding files: ' + err)\n  } else {\n    files.forEach(function (filename, fileIndex) {\n      console.log(filename)\n      gm(source + filename).size(function (err, values) {\n        if (err) {\n          console.log('Error identifying file size: ' + err)\n        } else {\n          console.log(filename + ' : ' + values)\n          aspect = (values.width / values.height)\n          widths.forEach(function (width, widthIndex) {\n            height = Math.round(width / aspect)\n            console.log('resizing ' + filename + 'to ' + height + 'x' + height)\n            this.resize(width, height).write(dest + 'w' + width + '_' + filename, function(err) {\n              if (err) console.log('Error writing file: ' + err)\n            })\n          }.bind(this))\n        }\n      })\n    })\n  }\n})\n\nSee the pyramid shape and all the }) at the end? Eek! This is affectionately known as callback hell.\n\nThe cause of callback hell is when people try to write JavaScript in a way where execution happens visually from top to bottom. Lots of people make this mistake! In other languages like C, Ruby or Python there is the expectation that whatever happens on line 1 will finish before the code on line 2 starts running and so on down the file. As you will learn, JavaScript is different. \n\nHow do I fix callback hell?\n\nCallback hell is caused by poor coding practices. Luckily writing better code isn't that hard!\n\nYou only need to follow three rules:\n1. Keep your code shallow\n\nHere is some messy browser JavaScript that uses browser-request to make an AJAX request to a server:\n\nvar form = document.querySelector('form')\nform.onsubmit = function (submitEvent) {\n  var name = document.querySelector('input').value\n  request({\n    uri: \"http://example.com/upload\",\n    body: name,\n    method: \"POST\"\n  }, function (err, response, body) {\n    var statusMessage = document.querySelector('.status')\n    if (err) return statusMessage.value = err\n    statusMessage.value = body\n  })\n}\n\n\n2. Modularize\n\nThis is the most important part: Anyone is capable of creating modules (aka libraries). To quote Isaac Schlueter (of the node.js project): \"Write small modules that each do one thing, and assemble them into other modules that do a bigger thing. You can't get into callback hell if you don't go there.\" \n\n\n3. Handle every single error\n\nThere are different types of errors: syntax errors caused by the programmer (usually caught when you try to first run the program), runtime errors caused by the programmer (the code ran but had a bug that caused something to mess up), platform errors caused by things like invalid file permissions, hard drive failure, no network connection etc. This section is only meant to address this last class of errors.\n\nThe first two rules are primarily about making your code readable, but this one is about making your code stable. When dealing with callbacks you are by definition dealing with tasks that get dispatched, go off and do something in the background, and then complete successfully or abort due to failure. Any experienced developer will tell you that you can never know when these errors happen, so you have to plan on them always happening.\n\nWith callbacks the most popular way to handle errors is the Node.js style where the first argument to the callback is always reserved for an error.\n\n var fs = require('fs')\n\n fs.readFile('/Does/not/exist', handleFile)\n\n function handleFile (error, file) {\n   if (error) return console.error('Uhoh, there was an error', error)\n   // otherwise, continue on and use `file` in your code\n }\n\n\n",

Screen readers will still read text with this style.\n\nHowever, if a link, form control, or other focusable element is given this style, the element would be focusable, but not visible on the pageu2014sighted keyboard users would likely be confused. This approach may be a viable option if the element does not contain navigable elements, though better techniques are available.\nAbsolutely positioning content off-screen\n\nThe following are the recommended styles for visually hiding content that will be read by a screen reader.\n.sr-only {\nposition:absolute;\nleft:-10000px;\ntop:auto;\nwidth:1px;\nheight:1px;\noverflow:hidden;\n}\n\nThe .sr-only CSS class (\"sr-only\" meaning \"screen reader only\", though the class name does not really matter) should then be referenced from within the tag of the element being hidden, as shown:\n<div class=\"sr-only\">This text is hidden.</div>\n\nSighted users will not see the hidden content at allu2014it will be hidden well to the left of the visible browser window. Because it is still part of the page content, screen readers will read it.\n\nCSS clip\nThis fairly modern technique will hide or clip content that does not fit into a 1-pixel visible area. Like off-screen content, it will be visually hidden but still readable by modern screen readers.\n\n{clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\nclip-path: inset(50%);\nheight: 1px;\nwidth: 1px;\nmargin: -1px;\noverflow: hidden;\npadding: 0;\nposition: absolute;}\n\n\n\n",

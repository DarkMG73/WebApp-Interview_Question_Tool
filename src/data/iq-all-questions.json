You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).\n\nNote: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: [7,1,5,3,6,4]\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.\n             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: [1,2,3,4,5]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.\n             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are\n             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.\nExample 3:\n\nInput: [7,6,4,3,1]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10 ^ 4\n0 <= prices[i] <= 10 ^ 4",

      "answer":"Because the first part of the question has to numbers being added together, 3 + 2, we will then have 5 + \"7\". What happens next is that JavaScript is designed to convert these two different types, a number and a string, so that both are strings. This process is called \"coercion\". Now, we have to strings being added together, \"5\" + \"7\". When two strings are added, they simply are concatenated. In this case, it forms \"57\". If we wanted to add these as numbers, we need to check and make sure each item is an actual number and not a string.\n\nMore examples\nThis is implicit coersion:\nconst total = 2 + 3 + '7';\nconsole.log(total); // 57\nconsole.log(typeof total); // string\n\nExplicit coersion:\nconsole.log(typeof String(5)); // string\nconsole.log(typeof Boolean(0)); // boolean\nconsole.log(typeof Number('4')); // number\n",

      "answer":"It is not necessary to know them all, but more to show a depth of understanding and familiarity with using a few. Adding to this with third-party API's experience, like the Braintree API, or Slack API, can help showcase real-world experience.\n\n\n\nA few options are:\n\t- Geolocations\n\n\t\t        if (navigator.geolocation) {\n\t\t            navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((pos) => {\n\t\t                console.log('Got Location', pos);\n\t\t            }, () => {\n\t\t                console.log('nope')\n\t\t            });\n\t\t        }\n\n\n\n- Media API: This API works for both audio and video. There are a number of methods including play() and pause() as well as load().\n\n- Text Track API: Picking up where the Media API leaves off, the Text Track API allows us to interact with text tracks (subtitles or captions) for the audio and videos.\n\n- Drag and Drop: There are a number of possibilities with this API. Among these, you can add  'draggable' attribute to allow a user to move an element then have event handlers in place on a drop zone so the browser knows where the element can be dropped.\n\n- History API: This spec gives developers more control of the user's browser session. Along with moving the the user forward or backward, we can check the length of the history and even add or remove entries. We can hold data enabling us to restore a page or just update the URL without refreshing the page.\n",

      "answer":"This question is designed to make sure we have a fundamental understanding of JavaScript and were it fits in with other languages.\n\nMany of commonly used coding languages are statically typed, meaning we must declare with type of data a variable will hold. For example, if we declare a variable to be an integer and then try to pass in \"Hello!\", we will get an error.\n\nIn dynamically typed languages,like JavaScript, we do not declare any specific type for a variable. we can pass in the number 1 and then later pass in \"Hello!\" and we will be able to do so, though the program might have trouble if it was needing a number for some processes. Ultimately, this can lead to type errors.\n\nSome developers prefer a typed language. TypeScript was created to allow one to use JavaScript, but it becomes a typed language. This still compiles down to JavaScript, but the developer can build in a typed environment.",

Mainly, just a general idea of what the purpose for the standard and how it is utilized on the front-end.\n\n- For a back-end interview , more detail that shows an understanding of the spec is needed as these are created on the back-end.\n\nRest is a series of patterns to help build API's. This allows for the user to interact with the API in a predictable and consistent manner. It also allows for various coding languages to be used to make the API without the user needing to change anything. \n\nThis is accomplished by a naming convention that has descriptive and direct names. So, for example, a call to get user data would be something like \"user\", and the route will reflect the HTTP method in some way. For example, gathering user info might be \"get/user\" or \"read/user\".\n\nAnother useful feature of a REST API is that the version will always be part of the route. This allows for new versions to come out at any time without ever affecting existing uses. \n",

      "answer":"Resets are so wildly common in CSS that anyone who is a front end developer type has surely used them. Do they do so blindly or do they know why? The reason is essentially that different browsers have different default styling for elements, and if you don’t deal with that at all, you risk designers looking unnecessarily different in different browsers and possibly more dramatic breaking problems.\n\nNormalize you might call a CSS reset alternative. Instead of wiping out all styles, it delivers a set of reasonable defaults. It doesn’t unset things that are already consistent across browsers and reasonable (e.g. bold headers). In that way it does some less than a reset. It also does some more than a reset in that it handles quirks you may never consider, like HTML5 audio element inconsistencies or line-height inconsistencies when you use sub and sup elements.",

Being caught off-guard or hacking together catch-phrases do relay that high-quality code matters to us. \n\nWe need to get a firm understanding of what clean code means and how we strive to incorporate this into what we do. We also need to be honest with our journey to learning these standards, meaning if we made a mistake that messed something up or cost a ton of time to fix, that is OK, as long we can explain how we realized it was because of some bad practice, perhaps a global variable or a function that tried to do fifteen things and generated multiple side effects, and saw all the time and struggle it casued. This is real-world learning and part of out path to excellence. Or, perhaps we talk about a lecture or article that grabbed us and sent us on a path to learn all about clean code, SOLID principles, etc, and how we made changes to adopt what we learned. \n\nMore than anything, the important thing here is to make it well understood that we have arrived at a high-cnocern for code quality and work to achieve very well-crafted code every day. Equally as important, that we are still, and always will be, trying to learn more and get even better in this area.\n\n\nGenerally, we want to make code that is:\n\n\tClear and understandable: descriptive, but brief naming conventions, well organised code with reasonable spacing and occasional notes when needed. \n    Easy to maintain: single-purpose functions, well-planned state management, etc.\n    Performant: Paying attention to the Big O - time complexity and space complexity.\n    D.R.Y: Do Not Repeat Yourself.\n    Testable: Separate business logic (customers, orders, account minimums and other data and rule-centered logic) from application logic (event listeners, UI, transferring data, and other interaction or structural logic).

I take no sides here, just the interviewer is unlikely to make a distinction, so it does not matter for answering.\n\nframeworks are basically just collections of JavaScript libraries that offer pre-written code for routine features and tasks. Basically, frameworks offer structure and functionality.\n\nSome basic benefits of frameworks:\n\n    Save time: Built-in components and functions, user management functionality, session handling, authentication logic and more.\n\n    Well-organized infrastructure: Basic structure is part of an organized approach to help with keeping business and application logic separate along with making the code easier to follow and maintain..\n\n    Security: Frameworks often have built-in security features.\n\n\n\nSpecific framework features:\n\n\t▪ Angular – Very small DOM updates make Angular fast. A downside is that memory consumption can double when loaded with DOM manipulation.\n\n\t▪ React – Performance is good even when the DOM update is on the larger side. Like Angular, memory consumption can double when loaded with DOM manipulation.\n\n\t▪ Vue – Performance is similar to React. Vue can outperform Angular and React when loaded with DOM manipulation \n\n\nThis is a good time to utilize a quick web search on this topic in order to dive a little deeper.

      "answer":"Closure is an inner function, that is accessible outside of its parent function's scope while maintaining its connection to the parent's variables and other data. This can be don to keep some data private and purposely expose other data.\nTo accomplish this, an anonymous function can be immediately invoked. In this function, data we wish to keep  private can be processed. Usually this data would be removed from memory via JavaScript's \"garbage collection\" memory clearing process. If this function returns a function, let's call it a child function, that accesses data from the parent function, the parent's data will remain in memory. In this situation, the only access to the parent function's data will be via whatever had been set up in the child function. In addition, every time the child function is invoked, a new function scope is created for the child function. The parent function scope is only created once. This means that we can invoke the child function to change a variable in the parent and the next time we invoke the child function the variable in the parent will still reflect the change. \n\nThis can be considered state management and might not be as useful today given other options to manage state. Still, this process can be used to protect sensitive data or even just a to keep a counter variable from being accidentally increased.\n\nSome examples\n// For comparison, this is a counter without closure\nlet counter = 0;\n\nfunction add1 () {\n\tcounter++;\n\treturn counter;\n}\n\nconsole.log(add1());  // 1\nconsole.log(add1());  // 2\n// The counter becomes unpredictable when it can be altered elswhere\ncounter++;\nconsole.log(add1());  // 4\n\n\n// This is a counter with closure\nconst add1 = (function () {\n  let counter = 0;\n\n  return function () {\n\tcounter++;\n\treturn counter;\n  };\n})();\nconsole.log(add1());  // 1\nconsole.log(add1());  // 2\nconsole.log(add1());  // 3\ncounter++;// error: counter is not defined\nconsole.log(add1());\n\n// Another, more complex example\n// In this travelAgent() in the child function made available, while \n// the \"trip\" variable and agent() function are accessible through \n// travelAgent(). The book() function, is only accessible through agent().\nfunction vacation() {\n\tvar trip;\n\n\tfunction travelAgent(itinerary) {\n\t\tagent(itinerary);\n\t\treturn trip;\n\t}\n\n\tfunction agent(itinerary) {\n\t\tif (itinerary === 'Orlando') {\n\t\t\ttrip = ['Orlando', 'Disney', 'Universal'];\n\t\t\tbook();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tfunction book() {\n\t\ttrip.push('booked');\n\t}\n\treturn travelAgent;\n}\n\nvar myVacation = vacation();\n\nconsole.log(myVacation('Orlando'));\n\n// Array [ \"Orlando\", \"Disney\", \"Universal\", \"booked\" ]\n",

      "answer":"An excerpt from MDN:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS\n\nCross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell browsers to give a web application running at one origin, access to selected resources from a different origin. A web application executes a cross-origin HTTP request when it requests a resource that has a different origin (domain, protocol, or port) from its own.\n\nAn example of a cross-origin request: the front-end JavaScript code served from https://domain-a.com uses XMLHttpRequest to make a request for https://domain-b.com/data.json.\n\nFor security reasons, browsers restrict cross-origin HTTP requests initiated from scripts. For example, XMLHttpRequest and the Fetch API follow the same-origin policy. This means that a web application using those APIs can only request resources from the same origin the application was loaded from unless the response from other origins includes the right CORS headers.\n\nThe CORS mechanism supports secure cross-origin requests and data transfers between browsers and servers. Modern browsers use CORS in APIs such as XMLHttpRequest or Fetch to mitigate the risks of cross-origin HTTP requests.",

      "answer":"For mnay years CSS preproccessors, like SASS & Less, offered the use of variables in CSS. Variables have now been incorporated into the the CSS specification as CSS Custom Properties. \nThe main benefit is that we now can assign a color, pixel size or any value once and have it affect everything we wish. Changing this value then changes every place the Custom Property y is ues. This means we can change the entire color scheme for a site simply by changing a few values. This can be used for margins to be able to adjust element white-space, font-family and more. A site can receive a major appearance change with the changing of a few values.\n\nTo use a Custom Property\n\n- While a Custom Property can be set up to be a local variable, we generally will want to make these available anywhere using the :root selector.\n- Inside of the selector. these Custom Properties are signified by double dashes preceding the name of the Custom Property. \n- Following the Custom Property name we can assign a value, like \"red\" or \"10px\", for example.\n- Using a Custom Property is just like using a variable. The Custom Property name is used in place of a value being assigned to a standard CSS property. Any value already assigned to that Custom Property will now be used as the value for that standard property.\n\n\n\tPop this example into an online editor, like https://codepen.io/pen/, Custom Properties come alive:\n\n\n\tCSS\n\t\t:root {\n\t\t    --headingColor: orangered;\n\t\t    --borderStandard: 5px solid skyblue;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\th1 {\n\t\t    color: var(--headingColor);\n\t\t    border: var(--borderStandard);\n\t\t}\n\n\t\th2 {\n\t\t    color: var(--headingColor);\n\t\t}\n\n\t\th3 {\n\t\t    border: var(--borderStandard);\n\t\t    color: var(--headingColor);\n\t\t}\n\n\tHTML\n\t    <h1>Example 1</h1>\n\n\t    <h2>Example2</h2>\n\n\t    <h3>Example 3</h3>\t",

      "answer":"In CSS, there is a general higher priority given to the rules added last as opposed to first. This is higher priority is not the final work, however, as there are guidelines within the CSS specification to allow for rules to override others based on specificity.\n\nStyle Sheets are generally better than inline-styles because they allow for separation of the styling and provide the developer a central location for making changes. In addition, we can also affect as few or as many elements as we want, where inline-styles only affect themselves (though inheritance can cascade \n\nSpecificity is the system the browser uses to decide which CSS declarations will be applied. Specificity is based on how specific to an element the rule is. In this, an inline-style is directly on the element and thus the most specific, though not usually a good idea because it eliminates the usefulness of a style sheet. \n\n\tAn ID is meant to address one specific element, and so this is next in line. \n\n\tA class covers any number of elements, making it very non-specific and, because of this, third in line. \n\n\tType selectors, like \"div\" or \" h1\" are even less specific to an element, and are fourth in line.\n\n\tWith the above in mind, there is a way to make make a CSS rule more specific. This can be done by chaining together additional references to the element. This can be adding more related detail from the element, like additional classes on the element, or even detail from the elements parents, like a parents ID or a class: \n\n\t#parent-id .child-class { ...declarations }\n\n\tThe above would no overrule this:\n\n\t#child-id\n\nIt is possible to override all of the specificity rules using \"!important\". While this will seem to make dealing with CSS specificity easier, it is usually a bad practice as it breaks CSS specificity order. In addition, trying to use \"!important\" multiple times on the same element enters into the same specificity rules one might be attempting to avoid. \n\nDrop this example into an online editor, like https://codepen.io/pen/, to see specificity and inheritance in action:\n\nCSS\n\tbody {\n\t\tcolor: skyblue;\n\t}\n\n\t h4 {\n\t\tcolor: darksalmon !important;\n\t}\n\th4 {\n\t\tcolor: black;\n\t}\n\t#outer-wrap-one {\n\t\tcolor: seagreen;\n\t}\n\n\th2 {\n\t\tcolor: red;\n\t}\n\n\t.orange-text {\n\t\tcolor: orange;\n\t}\n\n\t#purple-text {\n\t\tcolor: purple;\n\t}\n\n\n   \n\nHTML\n    <h1>This color is inherited from the body.</h1>\n\n\t<div id=\"outer-wrap-one\">\n\t\t<h2  style=\"color: gray;\" id=\"purple-text\" class=\"orange-text\">This color is set by the inline style, which overrides everything this element.</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t<h3>This color is inherited from the parent.</h3>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div id=\"outer-wrap-two\">\n\t <h4>!important just overrides everything</h4>\n       </div>\n",

      "answer":"The following is an excerpt from:\nhttps://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-an-event-loop-in-javascript\n\n\n\n\nThe call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed. Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack.\n\nThe event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the track for processing. It follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution.\n\nWhenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API. These are APIs built into the browser. Based on the command received from the call stack, the API starts its own single-threaded operation.\n\nAn example of this is the \nsetTimeout\n method. When a \nsetTimeout\n operation is processed in the stack, it is sent to the corresponding API which waits till the specified time to send this operation back in for processing.\n\nWhere does it send the operation? The event queue. Hence, we have a cyclic system for running async operations in JavaScript. The language itself is single-threaded, but the browser APIs act as separate threads.\n\nThe event loop facilitates this process; it constantly checks whether or not the call stack is empty. If it is empty, new functions are added from the event queue. If it is not, then the current function call is processed.",

      "answer":" There are two ways to use LESS. You can create a LESS file and convert it on-demand using a Javascript file or you can pre-compile it and use the resulting CSS file. \n\nUsing The LESS Javascript File\n\nFirst of all head down to the LESS website and grab the Javascript file. Once you have it, all you need to do is link it to your page like any other Javascript file.\n\t\n<script src=\"less.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n\nNext, create a file with the .less extension and link it to your page with the code below:\n\t\n<link rel=\"stylesheet/less\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"style.less\">\n\nMake sure that you link your LESS file before the Javascript file.\n\nOnce you have this setup you can paste your existing CSS code into the LESS file or just write a few new rules - it should work just like plain ol' CSS.\n\n\n\nCompiling The LESS File\n\nWhile this is a bit more tedious, in some scenarios this is preferred. LESS works by taking all the LESS code you write and converting it to CSS on the fly. Instead of doing this on demand we can convert our LESS file, save the CSS output and use that instead of doing the on-demand conversion on each page load.\n\nIf you're a Mac user you can use LESS.app, a small application which can detect all your LESS files automatically and whenever you save them it will convert them to a CSS file with the same name. This allows you to keep on linking to your CSS file on your pages while still utilizing the potential of LESS.\n\nIf you're on Windows you can use Winless which works in much the same way.\n\nIf you prefer command-line tools you can use the Node Package Manager (NPM) to install LESS. Some documentation is available on the LESS website. You can also grab the code directly from the Github repository. \n\n\nThere is more to this article at:\nhttps://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/get-into-less-the-programmable-stylesheet-language--webdesign-5216",

      "answer":"This is another question that is designed to make sure we know the fundamentals of CSS both in theory and in practice. CSS can often be overlooked in pursuit of more complicated functionality, but solid CSS skills are vital for the creation of anything that will touch a screen. While these type of questions can eliminate candidates that struggle, these can be great opportunities to expand and elevate those that grasp some basic concepts well.\n\nThe Box Model refers to the rectangular or square space that an element occupies when the browser is rendering the document. The rectangle or square is called the \"box\". Every element is inside its own box. \n\nAlong with containing the element, the position, size and other properties will be set. CSS will set these properties and can include the padding, border, box-shadow, and more. \n\nEach box is essentially made up of four parts: \"content area\", \"margin area\", \"padding area\" and \"border area\". \n\nThe content area has the item meant to be displayed. The margin area is just the minimum distance from the box to any other box around it while the padding area is the distance between the box and the content. The border area is just the line between the margin and padding areas. \n\nThe dimensions of the border area become the border-box. The dimensions of the content area become the content-box. This is important to understand as the box-sizing property settings can have dramatic affects on a document's layout. The default behavior is to treat the size of a box by its content-box. This means that padding and margin, both of which are outside of the content-box, are not considered when calculating the total width and height of an element. This is useful when we want to preserve the content width and potion it based on the content. In some situations this can cause problems, like an element extending past its parent's borders. For these cases, we can use the border-box dimensions to ensure all of the properties will be factored into the elements size and positioning.\n",

We had to pass that props to all components down the component tree to get it where it is needed which is the GrandChild component. The ChildComponent had nothing to do with the theme props but was just used as an intermediary.\n\nNow, imagine the GrandChild component was more deeply nested than it was in the top example. We would have to pass the theme props the same way we did here which would be cumbersome. This is the problem that Context solves. With Context, every component in the component tree has access to whatever data we decide to put in our context.",

      "answer":"5 Differences Between Arrow and Regular Functions\n\nIn JavaScript, you can define functions in many ways.\n\nThe first, usual way, is by using the function keyword:\n\n// Function declaration\nfunction greet(who) {\n  return `Hello, ${who}!`;\n}\n\n// Function expression\nconst greet = function(who) {\n  return `Hello, ${who}`;\n}\n\nThe function declaration and function expression I’m going to reference as regular function.\n\nThe second way, available starting ES2015, is the arrow function syntax:\n\nconst greet = (who) => {\n  return `Hello, ${who}!`;\n}\n\nWhile both the regular and arrow syntaxes define functions, when would you choose one instead of another? That’s a good question.\n\n1. this value\n1.1 Regular function\n\nInside of a regular JavaScript function, this value (aka the execution context) is dynamic.\n\nThe dynamic context means that the value of this depends on how the function is invoked. In JavaScript, there are 4 ways you can invoke a regular function.\n\nDuring a simple invocation the value of this equals to the global object (or undefined if the function runs in strict mode):\n\nfunction myFunction() {\n  console.log(this);\n}\n\n// Simple invocation\nmyFunction(); // logs global object (window)\n\nDuring a method invocation the value of this is the object owning the method:\n\nconst myObject = {\n  method() {\n    console.log(this);\n  }\n};\n// Method invocation\nmyObject.method(); // logs myObject\n\nDuring an indirect invocation using myFunc.call(thisVal, arg1, ..., argN) or myFunc.apply(thisVal, [arg1, ..., argN]) the value of this equals to the first argument:\n\nfunction myFunction() {\n  console.log(this);\n}\n\nconst myContext = { value: 'A' };\n\nmyFunction.call(myContext);  // logs { value: 'A' }\nmyFunction.apply(myContext); // logs { value: 'A' }\n\nDuring a constructor invocation using new keyword this equals to the newly created instance:\n\n\nNow, in contrast with regular functions, the method defined using an arrow binds this lexically to the class instance.\n\nLet’s use the arrow function as a field:\n\nclass Hero {\n  constructor(heroName) {\n    this.heroName = heroName;\n  }\n\n  logName = () => {\n    console.log(this.heroName);\n  }\n}\n\nconst batman = new Hero('Batman');\nNow you can use batman.logName as a callback without any manual binding of this. The value of this inside logName() method is always the class instance:\n\nsetTimeout(batman.logName, 1000);\n// after 1 second logs \"Batman\"\n\n...to read the rest got to: \nhttps://dmitripavlutin.com/differences-between-arrow-and-regular-functions/\n",

      "answer":"This addresses what happens when passing data from one variable to another. More specifically, this is about where variables point. \n\nThe original variable points to a place in memory. The new variable can either point to the same place in memory, which means the reference to the data was passed, or the new variable can point to a new place in memory that contains the same data, which means the values were passed to the new memory location.\n\nThe main reason this is important is shown by the results of changing either variable. If only a reference was passed, meaning both variables point to the same data at the same memory location, then changing a value will change change it for both variables, as well as any others pointing to the same place in memory.\n\nIf the actual values were passed and reside at a new location in memory, changing the values at the new memory location will only be visible with the new variable (and any others pointing to that location). The original variable is still pointing at the old memory location and remains unchanged.\n\nExamples:\nlet example1 = 1;\nlet example2 = example1;\nexample2++;\n\nconsole.log(example1, ' - ', example2);\n\nconst example3 = {\n  weapon: 'lightsaber'\n};\nconst example4 = {\n  ...example3\n};\nexample4.name = 'Darth Vader';\nconsole.log(example3, ' - ', example4);",

      "answer":"These snippets come from a great post by Ivan Sifrim at:\nhttps://medium.com/@ivansifrim/the-differences-between-call-apply-bind-276724bb825b\n\n\nCALL\n\nLet’s say that we have an object called obj. It\n only has one property called things, which has a value of 3. Totally \nunrelated to this object, let’s also make a function called addThings.\n\nlet obj = {things: 3};\nlet addThings = function(a, b, c){\n return this.things + a + b + c;\n};\n\nNotice this.things. Why does the addThings function\n mention that, when it doesn’t even have things? We need to pass it a \ncontext. We can do that with call. If we were to run this code:\n\nconsole.log( addThings.call(obj, 1,4,6) );\n\nIt would return the number 14.\n\nThat’s because the first parameter that call takes, is the context we want “this” to refer to. We passed it obj, which does have the things property. After we pass the context, we can pass the arguments like we usually would. In this case we passed 1, 4, 6. So this line:\n\nreturn this.things + a + b + c;\n\nwould be populated this way:\n\nreturn 3 + 1 + 4 + 6;\n\nResulting in 14.\n\nThat’s what call does! Let’s look at the apply method.\n\nAPPLY\n\napply is so similar to call that I don’t personally see its value. Pun intended.\n\nI’ll explain it since you might need to know about it in a job interview. \nThe main difference is the way we can pass arguments. We can pass them \nas an array. \n\nlet obj = {things: 3};\nlet addThings = function(a, b, c){\n return this.things + a + b + c;\n};\nlet arr = [1,4,6];\n\nconsole.log( addThings.apply(obj, arr) );\n\n\nBIND\nlet obj = {things: 3};\nlet addThings = function(a, b, c){\n return this.things + a + b + c;\n};\n\nconsole.log( addThings.bind(obj, 1,4,6) );\n\nWe expected the number 14, but that didn’t work. Instead, it returned a \nfunction. Bind works by returning a copy of the function, but with a \ndifferent context. We passed obj as the context, but we didn’t execute it. Let’s try that:\n\nconsole.log( addThings.bind(obj, 1,4,6)() );\n\nThat worked! We can also pass the arguments like this:\n\nconsole.log( addThings.bind(obj)(1,4,6) );\n\n",

      "answer":"The following excerpt come from bitofco.de:\nhttps://bitsofco.de/understanding-the-virtual-dom/\n\nWhy do we need a virtual DOM?\n\nTo understand why the concept of the virtual DOM arose, let’s revisit the original DOM. As I mentioned, there are two parts to the DOM - the object-based representation of the HTML document and the API to manipulating that object.\n\nFor example, let’s take this simple HTML document with an unordered list and one list item.\n\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n <head></head>\n <body>\n    <ul class=\"list\">\n        <li class=\"list__item\">List item</li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\n\nThis document can be represented as the following DOM tree:\n\nhtml\nhead lang=\"en\"\nbody\nul class=\"list\"\nli class=\"list__item\"\n\"List item\"\n\nLet’s say we want to modify the content of the first list item to \n\"List item one\"\n and also add a second list item. To do this, we will need use the DOM APIs to find the elements we want to update, create the new elements, add attributes and content, then finally update the DOM elements themselves.\n\nconst listItemOne = document.getElementsByClassName(\"list__item\")[0];\nlistItemOne.textContent = \"List item one\";\n\nconst list = document.getElementsByClassName(\"list\")[0];\nconst listItemTwo = document.createElement(\"li\");\nlistItemTwo.classList.add(\"list__item\");\nlistItemTwo.textContent = \"List item two\";\nlist.appendChild(listItemTwo);\n\nThe DOM wasn’t made for this…\n\nWhen the first specification for the DOM was released in 1998, we built and managed web pages in very differently. There was far less reliance on the DOM APIs to create and update the page content as frequently as we do today.\n\nSimple methods such as \ndocument.getElementsByClassName()\n are fine to use on a small scale, but if we are updating multiple elements on a page every few seconds, it can start to become really expensive to constantly query and update the DOM.\n\nEven further, because of the way the APIs are setup, it is usually simpler to perform more expensive operations where we update larger parts of the document than to find and update the specific elements. Going back to our list example, it is in some ways easier to replace the entire unordered list with a new one than to modify the specific elements.\n\nconst list = document.getElementsByClassName(\"list\")[0];\nlist.innerHTML = `\n<li class=\"list__item\">List item one</li>\n<li class=\"list__item\">List item two</li>\n`;\n\n\nIn this particular example, the performance difference between the methods is probably insignificant. However, as the size of the web page grows, it becomes more important to only select and update what is needed.\n\n… but the virtual DOM was!\n\nThe virtual DOM was created to solve these problems of needing to frequently update the DOM in a more performant way. Unlike the DOM or the shadow DOM, the virtual DOM isn't an official specification, but rather a new method of interfacing with the DOM.\n\nA virtual DOM can be thought of as a copy of the original DOM. This copy can be frequently manipulated and updated, without using the DOM APIs. Once all the updates have been made to the virtual DOM, we can look at what specific changes need to be made to the original DOM and make them in a targetted and optimised way.",

      "answer":"Responsive design is an approach to wed design where we create content that adjusts smoothly to various screen sizes. We can use relative units, like percentages and/or use media queries to make sure that the content and overall flow keeps the look, feel and function of the interface no matter what device or device orientation is being used.\n\nWe have a number of options these days. The following are options that can be used independently or in any combination we wish:\n\n\tCSS grid system: This is a grid system that can adjust to the screen size and makes for easy and predictable placement of elements.\n\n\n\tRelative units: Sizing content with percentages ensures there will not be any items that break the flow on small screens. \n\n\tFlexbox: Flex box properties allow us to use an intuitive approach to keep content positioned in a predictable way regardless of screen size.\n\n\tMedia queries: While media queries are powerful and very useful, these are generally meant to be a last resort. Not because there is anything wrong with them, only because, ideally, we can have content sized and positioned predictably and smoothly using the tools described above. This makes for more consistency across current commonly used screen sizes along with future devices with different screen sizes and a variety of less common, but still used, screen sizes. \n\n\t\tThere are times where we do need to set a point where content needs to have specific rules applied. These points we set up, called breakpoints, will usually correspond to specific screen sizes or device orientations. We can have breakpoints at desktop, tablet and smartphone sizes, plus additional media queries for portrait or landscape orientations.\n\n\n\tDrop this example into an online editor, like https://codepen.io/pen/, and moce the screen size around to see a responsive design  in action:\n\n\t\tCSS \n\t\t\t@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {\n\t\t\t\tbody {\n\t\t\t\t\tdisplay: grid;\n\t\t\t\t\tgrid-template-columns: 50% 50%;\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\tdiv {\n\t\t\t\theight: 200px;\n\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t#green {\n\t\t\t\tbackground-color: green;\n\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t#red {\n\t\t\t\tbackground-color: red;\n\t\t\t}\n\n\t\tHTML\n\t\t\t<div id=\"green\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div id=\"red\"></div>",

      "answer":"Async/Await allows for a little cleaner handling of Promises. Previously, we had to chain then() methods with a catch() at the end. While this works fine, these chains can become complicated and a bit hard to follow. \n\nWith Async/Await, we set up and async function and we can use the await keyword wherever we need to wait on a response. While waiting, the async function will be removed from the Call Stack.

The reason is because the columns don’t actually add up to 100% – they add up to more than that due to the padding. There is a number of ways to fix it:\n\nUsing box-sizing: border-box; on the appropriate elements is the most efficient fix.\nUsing calc() on the widths to remove the 1rem padding is another way.\nPutting the padding on an added internal wrapper element instead of the columns is a fix that will work with very deep browser support.\nAdjusting the numbers to make the math work is another way. For instance making the widths of the columns 4% narrower and using 2% for the padding instead.\nThere are other ways. The more solutions they can think of, the more creative and versatile a problem solver they are.\n\n\n\nbody {\n  padding: 30px;\n}\nheader {\n  background: lightblue;\n}\nsection {\n  background: lightgreen;\n  width: 75%;\n  float: left;\n}\narticle {\n  background: white;\n  margin: 0 0 1rem 0;\n}\naside {\n  background: pink;\n  width: 25%;\n  float: right;\n}\nheader, article, section, .module {\n  padding: 1rem;\n}",

Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):\n\n    Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.\n    Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n    Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..\n    Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nWrite a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state. The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.\n\nExample:\n\nInput: \n[\n  [0,1,0],\n  [0,0,1],\n  [1,1,1],\n  [0,0,0]\n]\nOutput: \n[\n  [0,0,0],\n  [1,0,1],\n  [0,1,1],\n  [0,1,0]\n]\n\nFollow up:\n\n    Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.\n    In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array. How would you address these problems?\n\n",

      "answer":"This shows we have gone the extra mile with websites before. What approach did we take? How did we test it?\n\nThe basic idea here is the correct answer is \"Yes, I have and here are a few key points I addresses...\". This means if that is not the answer,  then it is time to create a print stylesheet for a webpage.\n\nThe modern method:\n@media print { \n /* All your print styles go here */\n #header, #footer, #nav { display: none !important; } \n}\n\nThe older method:\n<link href=\"/print.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" media=\"print\" type=\"text/css\" />\n\n\nSome things to consider:\n- Colors do not show up in print as vividly or even with the exact same shading. \n- Colors that are on top of each other that are very similar might not look different at all on paper. Consider changing one to a strong and contrasting color. This is especially important for text.\n- Are large blocks of color really necessary? They can waste ink. Perhaps removing the color and adding borders if we want to preserve the general shape and style.\n\n",

This is usually not a good idea as it creates difficult to edit document with potentially inconsistent styling. It is important to separate concerns for multi-faceted projects like web pages.\n\n\t<h1 style=\"color: blue;\">Example</h1>\n\n- <style> tags in the documents <head> can be used to assign selectors to declarations. The browser will then link classes used on the elements in the <body> to the selectors in the <style> tag. This will apply CSS to the page.\n\n\tThis is better than inline styles, but still not ideal as we are not separating the styling from the structure.\n\n\t<style>\n        .selector-name {\n            color: red;\n        }\n    </style>\n\n- The most versatile, clear and maintainable method is using external style sheets. We can bring these in using a <link> tag in the document's <head>. The browser will then using the selctors in the external style sheet to link to classes on the page elements and apply the associated declarations.\n\n\tThe most versatile, clear and maintainable because it enables a sheet, or sheets, with only CSS-related material. We can group selectors as we see fit and even separate them into separate sheets when the need arises.

      "answer":"We need to have an answer for this. Statements anything close to \"I write good code. I don't need to debug\" is bad. We need to show that we have thought about the issue and have a decent amount of experience...even failures in process that we learned from. The company wants to know we will not be just as effective fixing problems as we are writing code.\n\nEveryone can have a different approach, but here are some basic steps:\n\n\t1. Define the specific problem. What, specifically is wrong? We need to start be defining the issue as clearly and completely as possible This step is not about probing or seeking answers. It is simply and only about making sure we have a clear and accurate foundation to ensure every step after this is heading towards a solution. \n\n\t\tFor example, \"It crashes\" isn't what we need to know. We need to know something more like:\n\n\t\t\"When I was using Chrome and had the app open for about five minutes and I had just done these actions and then it it started stuttering for about ten seconds and then it froze. After about a minute I saw an error popup that said this. This has happened twice before basically the same way.\"\n\n\t\tAnd the above can still just be the beginning of defining the problem. We need to end of with as much info as we can so we know where to start drilling down.\n\n\n\t2. Narrow the scope: Next we want to take our drill-down points and begin to narrow to as small an area or piece of code as we can. \n\n\t\tFor this, we start with any error that we uncovered from the first step. From there, the browser dev tools are usually a good place to go. Chrome Dev Tools' Lighthouse tool helpful if we have a slow-load issue. The Network tab in Chrome or Firefox dev tools is very helpful. The Performance tab is outstanding when trying to pinpoint interaction issues, like choppy animations and we will almost always be hitting the Console and breakpoints if debugging JavaScript issues. For HTML and CSS, the Inspector is going to get opened.\n\n\t\t\tMore tools: If we are working in a framework or library, there might be a browser extension or other tools to help us with this narrowing process.\n\n\t\t\tOne more note: Don't think there is only console.log available. console.table and many others can be a huge help.\n. \n\n\t3. Isolate: Once we gained an understanding of the specific symptoms and then narrowed the scope of our focus, we can now address these specific areas of code. Again dev tools Debugger, the Performance tool and other can help us fully isolate the specific block or lines of code.\n\n\t\tIf need be, it can help to isolate specific blocks of code in a separate editor, perhaps even an online editor like repl.it, codepen.io or jsbin.com. This can help zero-in on specific problems in the code.\n\t\tAlong the same line of thinking, commenting out blocks of code and/or temporarily inserting new simplified code can help ensure we have properly identified the problem area.\n\n\t4. Fix: By this point, we have arrived at the problem pieces of code. Now, we just need to correct the issue.\n\n\t5. Test...a lot: We have not fixed the problem at this point. We have only written the code that we think will correct the issue. Test. Test. Test again. At that point, we have fixed the issue.\n",

That target audience will be a business decision that will dictate whether Internet Explorer, Opera Mini and other browsers need to be considered and tested.\n\n- Unit tests. Ideally these are created during development, at the time specific code is being written, but they can be written after if needed. This \n\n- Test-driven development(TDD): With this approach we first create a test which specifies and validates what the code should do.

      "answer":"A very complete answer from:\nhttps://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-create-a-multicolor-text-in-html-and-css.html\n\nYou can create a multicolor text with the help of image editors such as Pixelmator, Photoshop and so on. So, you can create a multicolor image and embed it into your website.\nThe multicolor text will not be searchable with this method.\n\nAs a result, your code will look like the following:\n\n<img src=\"multicolortext.png\"/>\n\nMake separate elements¶\n\nAnother way is creating a text with separate elements by using the HTML <span> tag, which is an empty container. This means that you create a multicolor text by putting each letter in a separate element to define a different color for each letter of your text.\nExample of creating a multicolor text with separate elements in HTML:¶\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Title of the document</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <span style=\"color:#FF0000\">H</span>\n    <span style=\"color:#66CC66\">e</span>\n    <span style=\"color:#FF9966\">l</span>\n    <span style=\"color:#FFCCCC\">l</span>\n    <span style=\"color:#FF0066\">o</span>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\nTry it Yourself »\nResult¶\nUse CSS¶\n\nAnd finally, you can use CSS. This is the easiest way of creating such kind of text.\n\nPut your text in a <span> tag and give it a class name \"multicolortext\". Then, you need the CSS background-image property to add a gradient background to your text with its \"linear-gradient\" value, where you put the names of your preferred colors.\n\nTo get multicolor text instead of the multicolor background, you need to use the background-clip property, which lets you control how far a background image or color extends beyond the element's padding or content. This step gives some colors to your text, but not exactly what you want.\n\nYou can get the final result by making your text color transparent with the color property so that the background color will be reflected in the text.\nExample of creating a multicolor text with HTML and CSS:¶\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>The title of the document</title>\n    <style>\n      .multicolortext {\n        background-image: linear-gradient(to left, violet, indigo, green, blue, yellow, orange, red);\n        -webkit-background-clip: text;\n        -moz-background-clip: text;\n        background-clip: text;\n        color: transparent;\n      }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>\n      <span class=\"multicolortext\">Let’s be creative!</span>\n    </h1>\n  </body>\n</html>",

      "answer":"The days of great consideration being paid to Internet Explorer's many differences will, or possibly have, come to an end. This does not mean browser compatibility is no longer a concern. \nModern browsers are much more consistent with including features, but it is still good to check with a tool like https://caniuse.com/ or MDN to make sure new features are well covered.\n\nFor most browsers, we can easily download them and test our app. But what about older versions of each browser? What about these browsers on different devices. What if we need to test on Safari, but do not have access to a Mac? There are tools like https://www.browserstack.com/ to test web apps in many different ways. Some will even monitor real users on different browsers and devices. We can even have automated routines to test these scenarios.  \n\nBeyond testing, it is important that we know well what our target audience is going to be. If it is truly a global reach we are seeking, we need to consider things like Opera Mini (popular in parts of the world with slow internet), Baidu (a popular China-based browser), KaiOS' browser (mobile OS and browser used all over and especially in India) and any others that are used.\n\nAll of this does not mean that wide-reach intentions mean we need to remove most of our JavaScript just to make the app work right on Opera Mini. It just means just that we need to consider what happens to our product for the those users and work towards good solutions. \n\nWhithin any app, we should pay attention to current browser compatibility and utilize thinking along these lines:\n\n\t- We might just need to ensure there are fullbacks in place.\n\n\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\tposition: sticky; // Not fully supported by some browsers\n\n\t- We can plan our interactions and layouts so that nothing critical relies on technology not fully supported.\t\n\n\t- We can check for specific feature support in a browser and have separate functionality ready. This is not ideal as it requires extra consideration when maintaining the web app, but it is a workable solution.\n\n\t- We and the customer can consider the costs vs the gains related to supporting certain browsers. The benefits might not offset the costs of supporting a specific browser's use and/or the areas of the world it is popular.",

That is not realistic and it leaves the question wide open as to what they can expect from us if we encounter conflict while working there. Even a story about how we handled conflict poorly is fine, as long as we can talk clearly about how we thought and felt at the time and how we eventually learned how to handle it all better. \n\nTo put it simply:\n\tBe human. \n\tShow growth. \n\tShow thought. \n\tShow intent to understand others, even if they are acting poorly. \n\tShow a desire to explore the finer points of human interaction.\n\tShow that all of the above maters enough to have carefully thought about it.\n",

      "answer":"These questions are similar in that the interviewer is trying to get an idea of your general understanding of State and the tools available, as well as what not to do.\n\nThere are third party tools, like Redux, but, for a native approach, using the browsers's localStorage or session storage is one method. Browser cookies are available and used basically the same way. It is important to plan this out well. It is easy for this to become very complex and hard to maintain.\n\nWhile global variables can work to maintain State, use of these is strongly discouraged. Global variables can become unreiable if new scripts or plugins use the same name for a global variable and overwrite our variable.\n\n\tA localStorage example:\n\t const user = JSON.stringify({\n        firstName: 'Dylan',\n        lastName: 'Israel'\n    });\n\n    localStorage.setItem('user', user);\n\n    console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user')));",

      "answer":"This question is designed to see our thought process on this issue.\n\nHere are some basic steps for approaching a slow app:\n\n\t1. Define the specific problem. What, specifically is slow? Is the initial load slow? Are page transitions slow? Do the interactions, like menu animations, seem slow or choppy? Does this occur on only some browsers or devices? \n\n\t\tUltimately, the goal here is to get as clear a picture as possible as of each part that is slow. This enables us to find the best spots to begin drilling down.\n\n\t2. Narrow the scope: Next we want to take our drill-down points and begin to narrow each of those to as small a piece of code as we can. \n\n\t\tFor instance, if the issue is slow loading, a good place to start is either Chrome Dev Tools' Lighthouse tool or a page speed analyzer. One popular one is: \n\n\t\thttps://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/\n\n\t\tThese tools can help see where it is slow, like the first paint or how long until a user can actually interact with the page. From there it can help us pinpoint potential problem areas, like large images or slow server response.\n\n\t\tin a browser's dev tools we can use other tools, like the Network section to see detail on specific items like when they loaded, how long they took and if they were blocking progress. \n\n\t\tIf the issue is something not related to resources loading, dev tools can help narrow down the search using the Debugger, Performance, Inspector, Console and others. \n\n\t3. Isolate: Once we gained an understanding of the specific symptoms and then narrowed the scope of our attention, we can now address these specific areas of code. Dev tools Debugger can be great for stepping through JavaScript. The Performance tool can help see how an animation affects the page processing. \n\n\t\tIf need be, it can help to isolate specific blocks of code in a separate editor, perhaps even an online editor like repl.it, codepen.io or jsbin.com. This can help zero-in on specific problems in the code.\n\t\tAlong the same line of thinking, commenting out blocks of code and/or temporarily inserting new simplified code can help ensure we have properly identified the problem area.\n\n\t4. Fix: By this point, we have arrived at the problem pieces of code. Now, we just need to correct the issue.\n\n\t5. Test...a lot: We have not fixed the problem at this point. We have only written the code that we think will correct the issue. Test. Test. Test then take a break...test again. At that point, we have fixed teh issue.",

In some cases, authentication can be part of this connection. This might be a JSON web token, or some other data, included in the request.\n- The server will then send the requested data to the browser.\n- The browser will then render the page to the screen. \n\n- The new web page might include dependencies, like CSS ot JavaScript sheets, or images, etc. The browser will then either request these via the same connection, or, if the begin the process for a new connection to retrieve each item.\n\n- Once the browser page (tab or window) is closed, the connection to the server ends.\n\n",

      "answer":"Below is in excerpt from a great read on the subject at:\nhttps://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/adaptive-vs-responsive-design\n\n\n\nResponsive Design\n\nThe term Responsive Design was first coined by the web designer and developer Ethan Mcotte in his book, Responsive Web Design. Responsive designs respond to changes in browser width by adjusting the placement of design elements to fit in the available space.\n\nA responsive website shows content based on the available browser space. If you open a responsive site on the desktop and then change the size of the browser window, the content will move dynamically to arrange itself (at least in theory) optimally for the browser window. On mobile phones, this process is automatic; the site checks for the available space and then presents itself in the ideal arrangement.\n\nResponsive design is straightforward. Because it is fluid, it means that users can access your online world and enjoy as much of it on their handheld device as they would on a massive monitor. For this to be true, responsive design requires a very good conceptualization of the site and a deep knowledge of the needs and wants of the end users!\n\n\n\nAdaptive Web Design\n\nAdaptive Web Design was introduced in 2011 by web designer Aaron Gustafson in his book, Adaptive Web Design: Crafting Rich Experiences With Progressive Enhancement. It is also known as progressive enhancement of a website.\n\nWhere responsive design relies on changing the design pattern to fit the real estate available to it, adaptive design has multiple fixed layout sizes. When the site detects the available space, it selects the layout most appropriate for the screen. So, when you open a browser on the desktop, the site chooses the best layout for that desktop screen; resizing the browser has no impact on the design.\n\nSome sites have been quick to embrace adaptive design. Amazon, USA Today, Apple, and About.com configured themselves to be mobile-optimized websites. The layout displayed on a mobile website using adaptive design may be different from the desktop’s version. However, this is because the designers have picked a different layout for the phone’s screen rather than leaving the design to try to rearrange itself.\n\nIn adaptive design, it’s normal to develop six designs for the six most common screen widths; 320, 480, 760, 960, 1200, and 1600 pixels.",

      "answer":"This might sound like a silly question, but questions like this sometimes are used to get us to show our understanding of basic, but often needed, aspects of CSS. This will usually be a screening question, so a descriptive verbal outline will needed, not actual code.\n\nTo begin, we need to target our element via ID, or by class for multiple elements. We then want to set an equal width and height, perhaps 100px each. From there, we can either set the border for a few pixels or a background color or even both. This way we can see it. At that point, we have a square.\n\nMaking that square a circle simply requires a border-radius of 50% all of the way around. \n\nNow, that is a fixed width square or circle. We could make it responsive by using a percentage as the width and an equal percentage as padding-bottom. If there is content in the square or circle, one way to keep the sides equal would be to absolutely position the content. Ultimately, this is just an option. There are many ways to approach graphics in CSS, and purpose and the rest of the document will play into a plan for making the graphics responsive.\n\n\nPaste this example into an online editor, like https://codepen.io/pen/, to see the square and circle:\n\n\tCSS\n\t\t.square {\n\t\t\tbackground: lightgreen;\n\t\t\twidth: 50%;\n\t\t\tpadding-bottom: 50%;\n\t\t\tmargin: 0 auto;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t.square.circle {\n\t\t\tborder-radius: 50%;\n\t\t\tbackground: salmon;\n\t\t}\n\n\tHTML\n\t\t<div class=\"square\"></div>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"square circle\"></div>",

      "answer":"A nice YouTube video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ha8jEWtxc4\n\nA snippet from a good article (worth a fulle read):\nhttps://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/:~:text=Interpolation,%20often%20referred%20to%20as%20variable%20interpolation%20or,about%20interpolating%20a%20variable%20or%20interpolating%20an%20expression.\n\nTo put it concisely, interpolating is the process of evaluating an \nexpression or a string containing one or more variables, yielding a \nresult in which the variables are replaced with their corresponding \nvalues in memory.\n\nLet's take a look at an example instead. If you have some basic \nknowledge of PHP this might be easier to grasp. Let's say you want to \necho a string which contains a variable. The common way is to do this:\n\n\n$description  = \"awesome\";\necho \"Tuts+ is \".$description.\"!\";\n\nThis is not interpolation. This is string-concatenation. Basically we are concatenating (chaining together) three strings: \n\n\"Tuts+ is \",\"awesome\" (referenced as $description) and \"!\". \n\n\nNow, we could use interpolation rather than string concatenation:\n\t\n$description = \"awesome\";\necho \"Tuts+ is ${description}!\";\n\nThe braces around the variable tells PHP to print the variable value \nwithin the string. Note that it needs double quotes to work in PHP \n(which is true of most languages).\n\nAnyway, this is variable/expression interpolation. Whether you use \nconcatenation or interpolation is really up to you at this point, but \nlet's just say that interpolation is syntactic sugar for string \nconcatenation.\n\nSweet.\nWHAT ABOUT SASS?\n\nLet's have a look at how variable substitution works in Sass.\n\nSass variable names, just like in PHP, are prefixed with the dollar sign ($).\n \nThis is where the comparison ends though, because when it comes to \ninterpolation, Sass and PHP behave differently. There is a good reason \nfor this: Sass is built in Ruby, which uses #{} for expression substitution.\n\nIn Sass, you'd do the following:\n\t\n$description: \"awesome\";\n@warn \"Tuts+ is #{$description}!\";\n\nNote that the $sign is not subtracted from the variable name like in PHP. The variable is simply encapsulated in #{}. \n\n\n",

For each test case, there will be only two line of input, first line contains a string representing the tree as described below: \n\n    The values in the string are in the order of level order traversal of the tree where, numbers denotes node values, and a character “N” denotes NULL child.\n\n    For example:\n   (For this example, see https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/inorder-successor-in-bst/1)\n\n    For the above tree, the string will be: 1 2 3 N N 4 6 N 5 N N 7 N\n\nSecond line of each test case will contain the integer value K. K is the data of the reference node.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case output will be the Inorder successor of the given node. If no such successor is present output will be -1.\n\nYour Task:\nYou don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function inOrderSuccessor(). This function takes the root node and the reference node as argument and returns the node that is inOrder successor of the reference node. If there is no successor, return null value.\n\nExpected Time Complexity: O(Height of the BST).\nExpected Auxiliary Space: O(1).\n\nConstraints:\n1 <= T <= 1000\n1 <= N <= 1000, where N is number of nodes\n1 <= A[ ] <= 10000\n\nExample:\nInput:\n2\n20 8 22 4 12 N N N N 10 14\n8\n20 8 22 4 12 N N N N 10 14\n10\nOutput:\n10\n12\n\nExplanation:\nTestcase 1:\n                              20\n                            /      \\\n                          8       22\n                        /    \\\n                      4     12\n                            /     \\\n                         10     14\nInOrder traversal gives : 4 8 10 12 14 20 22\nHence successor of 8 is 10\n​\n\nNote: The Input/Ouput format and Example is given are used for the system's internal purpose, and should be used by a user for Expected Output only.

All the CSS including some big box shadows, are computed on the CPU and composited against that gradient backdrop every frame. The translate version, on the other hand, gets the laptop element elevated onto it’s own layer on the GPU (called a RenderLayer). Now that it sits on its own layer, any 2D transform, 3D transform, or opacity changes can happen purely on the GPU which will stay extremely fast and still get us quick frame rates.",

      "answer":"The fundamental principles of design are:\n\nBALANCE — Balance in design is similar to balance in physics. A large shape close to the center can be balanced by a small shape close to the edge. Balance provides stability and structure to a design. It’s the weight distributed in the design by the placement of your elements.\n\nPROPORTION & PROXIMITY — Proportion and proximity create a relationship between elements. It provides a focal point. Proximity doesn’t mean that elements have to be placed together, it means they should be visually connected in some way.\n\nALIGNMENT — Allows us to create order and organization. Aligning elements allows them to create a visual connection with each other.\n\nREPETITION — Repetition strengthens a design by tying together individual elements. It helps to create association and consistency. Repetition can create rhythm (a feeling of organized movement).\n\nRHYTHM - The spaces between repeating elements can cause a sense of rhythm to form, similar to the way the space between notes in a musical composition create a rhythm. There are five basic types of visual rhythm that designers can create: random, regular, alternating, flowing, and progressive.\n\nWHITE SPACE - As already mentioned in the rhythm section above, white space is part of a design. White space, or “negative space” it is sometimes called, is the areas of a design that are effectively, empty. While empty, these still provide impact and affect the elements around as well as the effectiveness of a design.\n\nPATTERN - Patterns are the repetition of multiple design elements working together. Wallpaper patterns are a common example of patterns. In design, patterns can also refer to set standards like, for example, top navigation is a common design pattern.\n\nCONTRAST — Contrast is the juxtaposition of opposing elements (opposite colors on the color wheel, or value light/dark, or direction — horizontal/vertical). Contrast allows us to emphasize or highlight key elements in your design.\n\nSPACE — Space in art refers to the distance or area between, around, above, below, or within elements. Both positive and negative space are important factors to be considered in every design.\n\nEMPHASIS - Emphasis deals with the parts of a design that are meant to stand out. Emphasis can also be used to reduce the impact of certain information. This is most apparent in instances where “fine print” is used for ancillary information in a design.\n\nHIERARCHY - Hierarchy relates to how well content can be processed by people using a website. It refers to the importance of elements within a design. The most important elements (or content) should appear to be the most important. This relates to emphasis, but is not the same. Hierarchy is the order in with things should appear important. Hierarchy is most easily illustrated through the use of titles and headings in a design. The title of a page should be given the most importance, and therefore should be immediately recognizable as the most important element on a page. Headings and subheadings should be formatted in a way that shows their importance in relation to each other as well as in relation to the title and body copy.\n\n\n",

      "answer":"A few basic elements of design are:    \n\n\nLINE – The linear marks made with a pen or brush or the edge created when two shapes meet.    \n\n\nSHAPE – A shape is a self contained defined area of geometric (squares and circles), or organic (free formed shapes or natural shapes). A positive shape automatically creates a negative shape.    \n\n\nDIRECTION – All lines have direction – Horizontal, Vertical or Oblique. Horizontal suggests calmness, stability and tranquility. Vertical gives a feeling of balance, formality and alertness. Oblique suggests movement and action    \n\n\nSIZE – Size is simply the relationship of the area occupied by one shape to that of another.    \n\n\nTEXTURE – Texture is the surface quality of a shape – rough, smooth, soft hard glossy etc.    \n\n\nCOLOR – Color is light reflected off objects. Color has three main characteristics: hue or its name (red, green, blue, etc.), value (how light or dark it is), and intensity (how bright or dull it is).",

In this case, both input and output will be given as signed integer type and should not affect your implementation, as the internal binary representation of the integer is the same whether it is signed or unsigned.\n    In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 2 above the input represents the signed integer -3 and the output represents the signed integer -1073741825.\n\n \n\nFollow up:\n\nIf this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?\n",

However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:\n\nI can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. \nX can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. \nC can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.\nGiven a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

      "question":"Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.\n\nDesign an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.\n\nExample: \n\nYou may serialize the following tree:\n\n    1\n   / \\\n  2   3\n     / \\\n    4   5\n\nas \"[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]\"\n\nClarification: The above format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.\n\nNote: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.\n",

Nothing else can override it, apart from another !important. You might be able to see where this is going, but once you start using them, you’ll almost certainly get into a position where you need to override a rule marked as !important, which forces you to use another one.

      "question":"A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Now suppose you are given the locations and height of all the buildings as shown on a cityscape photo (Figure A), write a program to output the skyline formed by these buildings collectively (Figure B).\nBuildings Skyline Contour\n\n(Figures A & B are available at https://leetcode.com/problems/the-skyline-problem)\n\nThe geometric information of each building is represented by a triplet of integers [Li, Ri, Hi], where Li and Ri are the x coordinates of the left and right edge of the ith building, respectively, and Hi is its height. It is guaranteed that 0 ≤ Li, Ri ≤ INT_MAX, 0 < Hi ≤ INT_MAX, and Ri - Li > 0. You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0.\n\nFor instance, the dimensions of all buildings in Figure A are recorded as: [ [2 9 10], [3 7 15], [5 12 12], [15 20 10], [19 24 8] ] .\n\nThe output is a list of \"key points\" (red dots in Figure B) in the format of [ [x1,y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], ... ] that uniquely defines a skyline. A key point is the left endpoint of a horizontal line segment. Note that the last key point, where the rightmost building ends, is merely used to mark the termination of the skyline, and always has zero height. Also, the ground in between any two adjacent buildings should be considered part of the skyline contour.\n\nFor instance, the skyline in Figure B should be represented as:[ [2 10], [3 15], [7 12], [12 0], [15 10], [20 8], [24, 0] ].\n\nNotes:\n\n    The number of buildings in any input list is guaranteed to be in the range [0, 10000].\n    The input list is already sorted in ascending order by the left x position Li.\n    The output list must be sorted by the x position.\n    There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, [...[2 3], [4 5], [7 5], [11 5], [12 7]...] is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: [...[2 3], [4 5], [12 7], ...]\n\n",

After answering this way, it then is OK to talk about a framework if one chooses. The important thing here is that they want to know you understand how JavaScript works when interacting with the DOM.\n\nTo access DOM elements, there are a number of options. We can grab ID's using getElementById(), similarly we can grab selectors, ID's or tags with querySelector() or querySelectorAll(). There is also getElementsByTagName() and others. Once we find the element, we can style, animate,  remove, alter the text and more.\n\nNote: getElementById() is faster than querySelector() and usually a better option.\n\nconsole.log(document.getElementById('id-example'));\nconsole.log(document.getElementsByTagName('h1'));\nconsole.log(document.getElementsByClassName('some-class'));\nconsole.log(document.querySelector('h1.some-class'));\nconsole.log(document.querySelectorAll('h1.some-class'))",

      "answer":"This is generally asked to get an idea of how much someone pays attention to good practices and, ultimately, will write easier to understand code and have an easier time jumping into someone else's code.\n\nGeneral naming conventions:\n-\tNames should be brief, but descriptive enough that the average non-developer could understand. For example, using \"d = new Date()\" might serve brevity, but can make no sense later in the program and require extra effort to understand. Conversely, \"theDateForTheDayTheAppIsRun = new Date()\" is clear, but unnecessarily long. Simply \"todaysDate = new Date()\" is brief and easily understood.\n\nA few JavaScript examples can be:\n- Camel case for variables: const lastName = 'Kenobi'\n- Pascal case for classes: class MainCharacter { }\n- \"is\" or \"has\" prefix for booleans.\n- Function calls that will be returning something can start with have a descriptive verb (\"update\", \"get\", etc).\n- As few variables as possible. This is not really a naming convention, but it greatly affects the abilty for the names of the variables that do get used to be easier to follow and keep track of.\n- Do not re-use variable names.\n- In many cases it is better not to make a variable equal itself with modification. This can be difficult to follow through and can often be better served with a new, variable descriptively named to match the newly formed data.\n- When reasonable, if a specific item in an array is being used, assign a more descriptive variable: const updatedFileId = changes[0]\n- Property names that do not need to be prefixed with the class name. \n\tWe do not need: class Car {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructor(brand, purchaseDate) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.carName = brand;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.carYear = purchaseDate;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n} \n\tInstead, we can use: class Car {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructor(brand) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.name = brand;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.year = purchaseDate;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t} \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t// in use it will still be descriptive\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconst myCar = new Car();\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmyCar,name = 'Jeep';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmyCar.year = '2017';\n- Avoid \"magic\" numbers, or numbers without a name, when possible. \n\tWe want to avoid: const forwardMovement = duration * 3;\n\tWe can use: const rate = 3;\n\t\t\t\t  forwardMovement = duration * rate;\n\t\t\t\t \n\nCSS & HTML examples:\n- Use nicely cascading rules to make for as few selectors as possible.\n- Kabab case for selectors: .inner-wrap\n- Descriptive selector names. This can be the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) method or similar.\n- Try to avoid using the same name for an ID and a class. These are technically independent from each other, but this can cause confusion for a developer.\n",

      "answer":"Comparing to see if two objects are not really just one referencing the other: Object.is(). This will tell us if one is really just a variable that was passed a reference to the original object, like with: const var1 = obj1; This is only a reference, so Object.is(var1, obj1) will equal true. If so, the values will always be identical.\n\nComparing unique objects can be a little more involved. There is a loose approach and a more strict approach. \n\nWe can test the number of entries in each, as a different number of entries would indicate they are different. We can do this by checking if one has more keys than the other using Object.keys().length or Object.getOwnPropertyNames().length.\nWhen iterating through the objects, we must also account for the possibility of nested arrays and/or objects. These might even go many levels deep.\n\nOne way is to turn both objects into strings using JSON.stringify() and then compare the strings. This will ONLY work if we know the keys will always be IN THE SAME ORDER. When using this method, any variance, like a key being in a different place, will cause the comparison to fail even though the values might be identical.\n\nA more strict approach is to iterate through each object and check the key-value pair against the other. This will work even if the keys are not in the same order. \n\n\nconst user1 = {\n  first: 'Lando',\n  last: 'Calrissian'\n};\nconst user2 = {\n  first: 'Lando',\n  last: 'Calrissian'\n};\n\n\n// Direct comparison\nconsole.log(user1 === user2);  // false\n\n// Stringify process\nconst stringObj1 = JSON.stringify(user1);\nconst stringObj2 = JSON.stringify(user2);\n\nconsole.log(typeof stringObj1);  // string\nconsole.log(stringObj1 === stringObj2);  // true\n\n\n\n// Iterating process possibiltiy\nfunction isSameObject (obj1, obj2) {\n  const props1 = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj1);\n  const props2 = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj2);\n\n  if (props1.length !== props2.length) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < props1.length; i++) {\n    const property = props1[i];\n\n    if (props1[property] !== props2[property]) {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return true;\n}\n\nconsole.log(isSameObject(user1, user2));  // true",

This allows us to build a component once and then use it multiple times. \n\nCommon uses are a navigation menu or model or buttons.

      "answer":"A clip from:\nhttps://www.katalon.com/resources-center/blog/ci-cd-introduction/\n\n\nCI/CD is the acronym for the combined practices of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). CI/CD practices are currently the most widely accepted choice to shorten software development and delivery cycle time.\n\n\nWhat is Continuous Integration?\n\nIn a CI practice, developers build, run, and test code on their own workstations before committing code to the version control repository. After changes are made to the repository, a chain of events is put into motion. A typical first step in this chain is to build the latest version of source code. If the build is successful, unit tests are executed. If unit testing succeeds, the build is deployed to test environments where system tests are performed (usually using automated tests). The team is notified about the status of this process, and a report is delivered to provide details, such as build number, defects, and the number of tests.\n\n\nWhat is Continuous Delivery?\n\nCD makes it possible to release builds to the production environment when needed. Allowing the team to deploy at will, CD effectively reduces time to market.\n\nBefore deploying software to production, the CD process includes performing automated system testing, unit testing (including API testing and load testing), and integration testing. The steps from CI to CD are usually completed automatically, including automated testing at the unit, integration, and system levels. As tests can fail at any level and environment, CI/CD must include a feedback channel to quickly report failures to developers.",

Flexbox will move elements in both directions when set for wrapping, like a vertical line wrapping the elements to the next line, but we do not control this. We choose either vertical and horizontal, unlike a grid system. \n\n\tFlexbox requires only: 'display: flex' to set up, which makes it very quick and easy. \n\n\tWhile Flexbox could be used on a whole page or large section and function well, it is ideal for handling smaller areas or situations where actual end placement is not important, just fluid response to different screen sizes.\n\n\t\tBasic setup:\n\t\t.container {\n\t\t  display: flex;\n\t\t}\n\nCSS Grid is two-dimension, meaning we can control the layout both horizontally and vertically. This makes it ideal for page layouts and large areas, though it would stil function well for one direction and small areas. CSS Grid is responsive and gives the user a lot of control.

      "answer":"A pseudo-element in CSS is similar to a pseudo-class in that it uses a keyword added to a selector, but he similarities end there. CSS pseudo-elements let us style a specific part of elements or even add to the beginning or end of the element. In addition, a pseudo-element will use double colons between the keyword and the selector. Technically, because this double-colon convention was not in place early on, the spec still allows this. That said, it is still expected that double colons are used.\n\n\nA few examples:\n\n::after - This creates an inline pseudo-element as the lst child of an element.\n\n::before - Similar to the above, this creates an inline pseudo-element as the first child of an element.\n\n::first-letter - This will apply styles to the first letter of the first line of an element.\n\n::first-line - This works like ::first-letter, but the style will apply to the whole line. What qualifies for the first line will depend on the width of the element, font size and other similar factors.\n\n::selection - When the user highlights a section, usually by clicking and dragging the mouse across text, we can style this highlighted area using the ::selection pseudo-element.\n\n\nDrop this example into an online editor, like https://codepen.io/pen/, to see a few of the pseudo-elements work their magic:\n\nCSS\n\tp::first-letter {\n\t\tfont-size: 50px;\n\t}\n\n\tp::first-line {\n\t\tcolor: orange;\n\t\tletter-spacing: 0.5em;\n\t}\n\n\tp::before {\n\t\tcontent: 'THIS IS BEFORE ---- ';\n\t\tcolor: darkblue;\n\t\tbackground-color: yellowgreen;\n\t}\n\n\tp::after {\n\t\tcontent: '--- THIS IS AFTER';\n\t\tbackground: gray;\n\t\tcolor: aquamarine;\n\t}\n\n\nHTML\n\t<p>The first line will be orange and have letter-spacing applied.

Functional components can’t use their own state and don’t have lifecycle methods.\n\nNow with React hooks you can.\n\nReact hooks allows us to take a Reactjs functional component and add state and lifecycle methods to it.\n\nIn simple words, React hooks are special functions to extend the capabilities of functional components and give them the possibility to have lifecycle events and manage state.\n\n\nThe existing React hooks 🍱\n\nThe new API comes with two main pre-existing hooks, and some others for other use cases\nBasics React hooks\n\nThe foundation of all React hooks, every other hook you will see is a variation of these three or are using them as primitives.\n\n    The useState is the State hook use it for declaring the state in your components\n    The useEffect is the Side effects hook use it for data fetching, manually changing the DOM, and etc.\n    The useContext use it in conjunction with Reactjs Context API. When the React Context provider updates, this hook will trigger render with the latest context value.\n\nAdvance React hooks\n\nThese are the most important of the other built-in React hooks that come with the library.\n\n    The useReducer is an alternative to useState, you should use it when you have complex state logic, if you’re familiar with Redux you will like it.\n    The useRef use it for accessing a DOM element with a mutable ref object. Is more useful than the ref attribute\n\n\n\nRules\n\n    Never call Hooks from inside a loop, condition or nested function\n    Never call a Hook from a regular function\n    Only call them inside functions components or custom hooks\n    Hooks should sit at the top level of your component\n    Hooks can call other Hooks\n\n\n\n",

This is called “mounting” in React.\n\nWe also want to clear that timer whenever the DOM produced by the Clock is removed. This is called “unmounting” in React.\n\nWe can declare special methods on the component class to run some code when a component mounts and unmounts:\n\nclass Clock extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {date: new Date()};\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {  }\n  componentWillUnmount() {  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>\n        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nThese methods are called “lifecycle methods”.\n\nThe componentDidMount() method runs after the component output has been rendered to the DOM. This is a good place to set up a timer:\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.timerID = setInterval(      () => this.tick(),      1000    );  }\n\nNote how we save the timer ID right on this (this.timerID).\n\nWhile this.props is set up by React itself and this.state has a special meaning, you are free to add additional fields to the class manually if you need to store something that doesn’t participate in the data flow (like a timer ID).\n\nWe will tear down the timer in the componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method:\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    clearInterval(this.timerID);  }",

But sometimes there are situations where imperative actions are necessary.\n\nRefs in React provides a way to access the React elements (or DOM nodes) created in the render() method.\n\nWhen parent components need to interact with children components, we typically use props However, in some cases we might need to modify a child without re-rendering it with new props. That's when refs get the spotlight.\nWhen Should I use Refs?\n\nWe advise to use refs in the following situations:\n\n    Integrating with third-party DOM libraries.\n    Triggering imperative animations.\n    Managing focus, text selection, or media playback.\n\nSo once we've determined that we really should be using refs, how do we use them?\nUsing Refs in React\n\nThere are various ways in which you can use refs:\n\n    React.createRef()\n    Callback refs\n    String refs (legacy)\n    Forwarding refs\n",

For example, a navigation menu might be <div id=\"nav\" ></div>. With HTML5, we became able to use a \"nav\" tag, or \"footer\" tag and many more. This makes our template more descriptive and easier to follow, which are always goals when working towards clean code.\n\n\nHere are a few of the descriptive tags available:\n\n    <nav></nav>\n\n    <header></header>\n\n    <main>\n        <article></article>\n        <section></section>\n    </main>\n\n    <aside></aside>\n\n    <footer></footer>",

      "answer":"This type of question is designed to probe our experience with CSS libraries. This does not mean we need to have used many or any of them, just that we have considered one or some and why we opted to or not to. Our answers are best if they showcase a few pros and cons of CSS libraries in general and, ideally, one or two specifically.\n\nPros: CSS libraries can help ensure a consistent look. If someone is not very interested in design or is making a small-audience tool, like something for an office work group, then a CSS library can help them avoid spending time on styling. In addition, libraries like nova-skeletons can make prototyping quick and easy by handling all of the standard styling for us. Some libraries, like Water.css, allow a developer to just start building without focusing on the layout or even adding a single class as many common elements will be receive basic styling. \n\nCons: Many CSS libraries will require the use of many specific classes, which can crowd an HTML page. For some, there are HTML structure requirements, as well. There can begin to be a very predictable styling that becomes overused and, possibly even boring. We can also rely so much on these libraries that we loose our own understanding of how the many facets of CSS work.\n\nSample CSS Libraries\n\n\n\tWater.css - this is a set of default styles that handle styling without us needing to add a single class. This is a great way to start building a site and have it look right from the beginning.\n\n\thttps://watercss.netlify.com/\n\n\n\tnova-skeletons -  Used to create grey blocks for dummy content in prototypes.\n\n\tvov.css - set of pure CSS animations.\n\n\t\t\thttps://vaibhav111tandon.github.io/vov.css/\n\n\n\tWoah.css - Animation Library for eccentric web developers.\n\n\t\thttps://github.com/joerez/Woah.css\n\n\n\tCSS Wand - A small set of pure CSS-based animations that we can paste and go as we want. \n\n\t\thttps://www.csswand.dev/\n\n\n\tAtomize - This is based on the Atomic CSS methodology.\n\n\t\thttps://github.com/o-t-w/atomize\n\n\n\tBootstrap - This is probably the most well-known libraries that has HMTL, CSS and JS. As a CSS library it covers a lot. Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system and much more.\n\n\t\thttps://getbootstrap.com/\n\n\n\tRaisin CSS - This is a utility CSS library with pre-built modules for CSS Grid, FlexBox, breakpoints, positioning, and more.\n\n\t\thttps://github.com/tretapey/raisincss\n\n\n\tSassyfication - A collection of commonly-used variables and mixins for SASS.\n\n\thttps://github.com/Simonwep/sassyfication\n\n\n\tSpectrum CSS - Based on Adobe's design system \"Spectrum\".\n\n\t\thttps://github.com/adobe/spectrum-css\n\n\n\tBox-shadows.css - Box shadows all day, every day.\n\n\t\thttps://github.com/anthonykrivonos/flix-carousel\n\n\n\tFlix Carousel - A carousel based on Netflix’s preview carousels.\n\n\t\thttps://github.com/anthonykrivonos/flix-carousel\n\n\n\tAnimation Library - A collection of simple animations.

      "answer":"A CSS preprocessor is a program that lets you generate CSS from the preprocessor’s own unique syntax. There are many CSS preprocessors to choose from, however, most CSS preprocessors will add some features that don’t exist in pure CSS, such as mixin, nesting selector, inheritance selector, and so on. These features make the CSS structure more readable and easier to maintain.\n\nThe usage depends on the type of project but the following advantages/disadvantages come with a preprocessor.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nCSS is made more maintainable.\nEasy to write nested selectors.\nVariables for consistent theming. Can share theme files across different projects.\nMixins to generate repeated CSS.\nSass features like loops, lists, and maps can make configuration easier and less verbose.\nSplitting your code into multiple files. CSS files can be split up too but doing so will require an HTTP request to download each CSS file.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nRequires tools for preprocessing. Re-compilation time can be slow.\nNot writing currently and potentially usable CSS. For example, by using something like postcss-loader with webpack, you can write potentially future-compatible CSS, allowing you to use things like CSS variables instead of Sass variables. Thus, you’re learning new skills that could pay off if/when they become standardized.\n\nSelecting a preprocessor really boils down to preference, and it can be revealing to see how a particular developer might decide to use one over the other for your project.",

Below are a few basic approaches, though a web search (click the \"More About this Question\" button for that) will yield a wealth of detail and other options.\n\n- We can just give an amount we would like to make and we think we are worth. it is simple and direct, though it might be a factor in eliminating us from the candidate list if the number far exceeds what the company wants to spend on the position or thinks we are worth. This approach is not concerned with staying in market value. It is more about weeding out companies that can not or do not wish to pay what we value our services at. \n\n- We can take our current salary and just raise that a little. Assuming we are applying for a similar position, or even slightly elevated, this keeps us around market range. \n\n- If the job is meant to be an entry into a new career, pushing for more money might hurt the greater purpose. We might want to consider looking for the salary range listed in the job post and speaking to an amount towards the middle, with a minimum around the listed minimum. Or, perhaps, if our situation is one where little more or less would not matter and getting in the door is the focus, being honest about this can be OK. It would be best to also ask how soon someone is eligible for a raise and to make sure they do not offer below their posted minimum. There are some who would say never ask for or imply the offered minimum, but getting the first foot in can make tremendous difference and then enable us to make the next interview about what we are really worth.\n\n- Use online tools to find a market salary range and then ask for a salary somewhere between the average and the top salary depending on where our skills and experience put us.\n\n\n\tA few tools for finding market value:\n\n\t\tGlassDoor: https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/index.htm\n\t\tPayScale: https://www.payscale.com/my/survey/choose\n\t\tLinkedin Salary Tool: https://www.linkedin.com/salary/\n",

      "answer":"This answer comes from:\nhttps://resource-centre.net/html5-tutorials/bullet-point-lists/\n\nBullet Point Lists (or Unordered Lists)\n\nThe first kind of list we will look at is using bullets.\nUnordered List – the <ul> Tag\n\nBullet point lists are also known as unordered lists (UL) because there is no numbering involved. That is why a bulleted list uses the <ul> </ul> tag pair. Here is a basic example:\n\nThe whole list is surrounded by <ul> </ul> for a start. When you open your list tag, make sure you automatically type your closing tag and then proceed to fill your items between them.\nThe type Attribute\n\nThe type attribute determines what kind of bullet you are seeing on the page. Although through CSS you can specify a wide-range of bullet styles, and even use your own image, in raw HTML it is best to stick with the common types which are\n\n    type=\"circle\" – an unfilled circle\n\n    type=\"disc\" – a filled circle\n\n    type=\"square\" – a filled square\n\nList Items – the <li> Tag\n\nEach individual item in your list is wrapped in its own <li> </li> tag pair. You can often get away without the </li> but I would recommend keeping it in, just so you maintain healthy coding habit.\n\nThe list above I placed in individual <ul> but each <li> also supports the type attribute, such that I could create\n\n    Square\n    Disc\n    Circle\n\nNot sure why you would want to do that, but you can if you want to!\n\nBullet List Indentation\n\nBefore you apply any CSS to your list, HTML (or more accurately, your browser) will apply indentation to your list, so it stands out from your normal paragraph <p> tags.\nOrdered / Numbered Lists – the <ol> Tag\n\nIf you want to present your list in an ordered fashion, then the <ol> tag is your friend. By default this will give you a numbered list, but the type attribute gives you flexibility, in the same way as bullet point lists do.\n\nwhich outputs\n\n    Item 1\n    Item 2\n    Item 3\n\nThe type attribute offers a few more options in ordered lists compared to bulleted ones. A bit more guidance on this can be obtained at W3Schools.\nStarting an Ordered List On A Different Number\n\nSay you were putting together some instructions to build a table. You may want to use a numbered list to achieve this. However, if you wanted to put images and extra text between each stage, you would probably need multiple lists. The problem is that each list starts at number 1 (or letter A) by default. That would screw up your instructions!\n\nThankfully HTML has the start property to allow you to start on a subsequent number:\n\nThis outputs:\n\n    Step Four\n    Step Five\n    Step Six\n\nReversing The Order\n\nIf you want to show your numbers (or letters) in reverse order, then this is really easy too. You might want to do a ‘Top 10’ with your best item announced last, for example. This can be done by adding the word reversed into your Ordered List opening tag:\n\nAnd this would make your list look like this:\n\n    First LI\n    Second LI\n    Third LI\n    Fourth LI\n    Fifth LI\n\nMulti-Level Bullet List in HTML\n\nWith patchy browser support (and sometimes undone by CSS in some sites) you can create a multilevel list. This is achieved by embedding one list inside another:\n\nWhich creates:\n\n    Top Level Item\n        Sub-Item 1\n        Sub-Item 2\n    Top Level Item\n\nYou can use a combination of <ul> and <ol>. That may be useful if you want bullet points under a numbered list.\n\n    Top Level Item\n        Sub-Item 1\n        Sub-Item 2\n    Top Level Item\n",

      "answer":"This is a basic question, but can often stump interviewees as many do not put much thought into their CSS methodology. This is a chance to separate us from others.\n\nWhile this should be about our individual CSS approach, here are a few good CSS principles as jump-points.\n\n\t- There are a few things that are always best practices and should be goals with CSS, as well:\n\n\t    \n\t    DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself\n\t    Efficient - Focus on keeping code to a minimum.\n\t    Maintainable - Keeping code well organized and a descriptive naming convention along with brief notes where appropriate.\n\n\n\t- Explain naming conventions, like BEM, and how and why we chose the names that we do.\n\t- Atomic Design principles look at the UI as both a cohesive unit and a collection of small parts. There are five stages of the Atomic Design system that ensures we are respecting the small pieces and the unified whole.\n\n\t\tFor more detail, read Brad Frost's great work at: https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/\n\n\t- Consider how to approach specificity to avoid unintended overriding of styles.\n\n\t- Group related selectors.\n\n\t- Use section title blocks to make sections clear and obvious as we scroll through.\n\n\t\t\tFor example:\n\n\t\t\t/*----------------------*\\\n\t\t\t  Nav Settings\n\t\t\t\\*----------------------*/\n\n\t\t\t.menu { }\n\n\t- Meaningful use of white space to make different sections clear.\n\n\t-  If the CSS document is very large, simple table of contents can go a long way in keeping it easy to follow.\n\n\t- Splitting CSS into separate sheets in some cases can make it much easier to maintain. An example might be to have a separate sheet for responsive media-queries.\n\n\n\t- If multiple selectors are being grouped, keep related selectors on the same line and unrelated each on a separate line.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t.selector1, .selector1--mod,\n\t\t\t.selector2 { }\n\n\t- Use a space between the selector and the opening brace and ensure they are on the same line.   \n\t\t\n\t\t\t.selector2 { }\n\n\t- Make sure properties and values are on the same line.\n  \t- Keep a space between the colon and the value.\n\n  \t\t\tcolor: blue;\n\n\t-  Make sure to have declarations each on their own line.\n\t\t\tdisplay: flex;\n\t\t\tbackground-color: gray;\n\t\t\tcolor: blue;\n\n\t- Closing brackets deserve their own line.\n\n\t- Each declaration should be indented (two spaces or a tab)\n\n\nA great source for more detail is: https://cssguidelin.es/",

Other numeronyms you may be familiar with include: i18n (internationalization), P2P (peer to peer), WWII (World War 2), etc.\n\nThe word accessibility has different meanings in different contexts. On the internet, the use of the term a11y helps to identify content related specifically to digital accessibility. For example, it is often used as a Twitter hashtag by digital accessibility practitioners.\n\n\nMaking things accessible translates to better opportunities, as it means more people can use them. Accessible digital experiences also remove barriers. This is incredibly important for things like employment, an area where disabled people have been historically faced discrimination.\n\nIn addition, recent researchhas revealed that there are billions of dollars in potential revenue if accessibility needs are accommodated.

This can make writing more maintainable, future-proof code easier while reducing the amount of code needed to be written in, most cases. For a preprocessor to work, we need to have the compiler generate the real CSS on the development side or have the compiler needs to be installed on the server.\n\nWhile a CSS preproccessor is most useful large-scale user interfaces with many CSS rules, they can still be beneficial on smaller projects. Much of these benefits lie in the ability to work in CSS much like we work in JavaScript or other coding languages. Examples of this are functions, variables, nesting, and even looping (similar to \"for\" loops) or even the ability to use future CSS tools before they are official. Not all CSS preproccessors incorporate all of these, but each preproccessor will have its own approach and tool set. \n\nThere are potential downsides to CSS preprocessors. Future developers will need an understanding of the preprocessor to be able to jump in. In addition, the need to compile means more time is needed before deploying. There can also be slow down while developing as the preproccessor works. None of these are very significant, but they are considerations. \n\nA few popular CSS preproccessors are:\nSass \nLess \nStylus\nCSS-Crush\nMyth",

      "answer":"A pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector, marked with a colon : in between. This designates the rule to apply to a special state of the element. These special states are numerous, but a few are:\n\n:checked - This shows a checked or toggled-on state for any radio (<input type=\"radio\">), checkbox (<input type=\"checkbox\">), or option (<option> in a <select>) element.\n:active - This shows an element is being activated by the user. This will often be a button or similar action element, but, technically, can be any element. Activated would usually mean the user clicked on the element.\n\n:hover - When a user interacts with an element without actually activating it, the element will have the hover state. This is most often achieved by hovering the cursor over the element using a mouse, but can also be achieved on touchscreens. The later can be a problem, as the actual application of the hover state varies on different browsers and devices. Due to this, the hover state should not be necessary for relaying information. For example, a link or button should not require the user hover over it in order to see it is clickable.\n\n:visited - This is an link that has already been activated.\n\n:first-child - As it sounds, this is the first element to a parent.\n\n:last-child - Opposite of first-child, this is the last element to a parent.\n\n:nth-last-child(Xn) - This element is the one that is the given number away (X) from the end.\n\n:nth-of-type - This takes the type(tag name) and given number and then assigns this pseudo-class to elements that fit this pattern.\n\n\nDrop this example into an online editor, like https://codepen.io/pen/, to see a few of the pseudo-classes in action:\n\nCSS\n\t #characters:hover {\n\t\t            background-color: black;\n\t\t            color: white;\n\t\t        }\n\tli {\n\t\tpadding: 1em;\n\t}\n\n    li:nth-child(odd) {\n        background: blue;\n\t\t\t\tcolor: white\n    }\n\n    li:first-of-type {\n        color: red;\n    }\n\n\n\nHTML\n\t\t<h3 id=\"characters\">Characters</h3>\n    <h4>Self-taught or Not Podcast</h4>\n\n    <ul>\n        <li>Palpatine</li>\n        <li>Rey</li>\n        <li>Vader</li>\n        <li>Luke</li>\n    </ul>",

      "answer":"Traditional websites, known as Multi-Page Applications (MPA), have different pages. Each page loads independently and will load any needed dependencies. Clicking to a new page will again load needed dependencies and render the new page. \n\nSingle Page Applications use one page that loads different templates as needed. This means page dependencies can be loaded once and used throughout the session with ever being reloaded. Templates can still have dependencies loaded if needed. Sections large or small can be loaded or reloaded without reloading the page. \n\n\n\nA worthy read on the subject: https://tinyurl.com/yy9y8ckt\n\n\nHere are excepts from that article that detail the benefits and drawbacks of SPA's:\n\n\"Advantages of Single Page Apps\n\nSingle page apps aim to improve website performance and increase conversions. Let’s explore more benefits of a single page application:\n\nFast and responsive design. Since a single page web app updates the desired content only, it dramatically improves the loading time. Most resources like HTML, CSS, and Scripts are loaded just once, at the very beginning. Furthermore, by loading just small chunks of content SPAs make the interactions prompter.\nAdaptable layout. SPAs are easy to adapt to mobile device browsers as well as mobile app design if you wish to offer your users such along with the web version.\nCaching capabilities. SPAs can effectively cache any local data. They send a single request to a web server and after that save all the data it gets. Since the apps have ongoing access to this data, they let the users keep on working even if they’re lacking strong connection.\nIncreased single page application performance. Compared to a standard web resource, single page apps load only the data that changes (without header, sidebar, and different parts of UI). Meanwhile, caching the status of the previously visited pages SPAs contribute to the immediate back and forth transitions.\nContinuous UX. When you build a single page web application, you get simple continuous user experience. Coming with a clear beginning, middle, and end such apps contribute to a flawless interactive UX utilizing parallax scrolling along with different transition and animation effects.\n\nHow can you benefit from using SPAs\n\nIn addition to the advantages of a single page application, there are also a few disadvantages you should be aware of. But don’t worry, they are not ones you can’t bear.\nDrawbacks of Single Page Apps\n\nFor all their great qualities, SPAs do have some disadvantages when compared to multi-page applications. So, let’s see what they are.\n\n    Poor SEO optimization. Since SPAs work on JavaScript loading data upon request from the client, they drastically lose in SEO optimization. Unchanging URL results in the lack of unique addresses for different pages. Consequently, optimizing the site for search engines becomes a real headache. However, thanks to the algorithm recently launched by Google, the dynamic pages can now be indexed.\n    Difficulties in the development process. Being a relatively new technology, a single page app requires great efforts and deep knowledge to troubleshoot. You may want to find a team to develop a single page web application with experience in dealing with a certain framework and tools like NPM, Webpack, SystemJS, and Gulp. Additionally, the code is hard to track, especially when you try to integrate the third-party elements like modules, plugins, and extensions.\n    Poor link sharing capability. The single-page approach has a single URL address which makes sharing bigger pieces of content a more complex process from the development perspective.\n\nThese are the major drawbacks you may face using SPA software. Some others include a higher development price, security issues, lack of scalability, etc. Yet there are ways to overcome it and more experienced developers can help you with that.\"\n\n",

That could be software like Trello, or even just a whiteboard. You need the different roles, like the Product Owner and the Scrum Master. The actual tools you need are not as big as the roles involved.”\n\nLet’s break down the pieces and parts that make Scrum happen:\n\n    Scrum starts with a Product Owner. This is the person who represents the final user’s best interest, and has the authority to say what goes into the final product.\n\n    That Product Owner is in charge of making the Backlog, a list of tasks and requirements the final product needs. Here’s an important part: The backlog MUST be prioritized. That’s the job of the Product Owner. \n        If I were using Scrum to design a car, items like “Must have an engine” would be near the top of my prioritized list, because the car can’t work without it. “Must be painted red” would be lower on my priority list; it might still be important to me, but it’s not a requirement for the car to run.\n\n    Next up is the Sprint. A Sprint is a predetermined time frame within which the team completes sets of tasks from the Backlog. The length of time depends on the needs of the team, but two weeks is pretty typical.\n\n    Teams meet every day to give progress updates in the Daily Scrum. Many people also call these “Daily Stand-Ups.”\n\n    Each Sprint ends with a review, or Retrospective, where the team reviews their work and discusses ways to improve the next Sprint.\n\nAs you can see, there’s not really any special equipment or training you need to get started. The hardest part is learning the lingo, and staying true to the rules and guidelines that make Scrum work.\n\t_______________________________\n\n\n\tAnd implementing this? The article continues:\n\n\t_______________________________\n\tHere are some basic steps to get started:\n\n    Download and print the PDF version of the official Scrum Guide: Read it on your commute or during your lunch break with a highlighter in hand. Highlight the phrases and roles that are new to you and start working on memorizing what each one means.\n\n    Pick your roles: You need a Product Owner (speaks for the user, final say in what the project needs), a Scrum Master (helps the team move along based on the principles of Scrum), and team members. Remember, there’s no room for egos in Scrum. Scrum runs on a “servant leader” model.\n\n    Create your product Backlog: The Backlog is where you list out everything the project needs, ordered by importance. Keep in mind that the Backlog is never complete. As the project takes shape and new needs emerge, you will add to this. The Product Owner takes primarily responsible for this.\n\n    Plan your Sprint: Next, it’s time to pick tasks from the backlog to be completed in your first Sprint. Sprint’s are time-limited. You can decide a time length that works for you, but they are always less than one month. During the Sprint Planning, the team decides what tasks to include in this Sprint and who will be responsible for them.\n\n    Get to work! Time to start working on that Sprint! Team members work on their tasks, and everybody checks in on their progress at the Daily Scrum Meeting. This meeting lasts no more than 15-minutes and answers three questions: What did you work on yesterday? What will you work on today? Is there anything blocking your work today that you need help with?\n\n    Review your work: At the end of the Sprint, the team reviews the work accomplished and presents their completed tasks.\n\n    Review your process: During the Retrospective meeting, you’ll review how the actual work process went and plan ways you can improve your work and be more efficient next time.\n\n    Repeat! With your first Sprint complete, it’s time to start over again. Pick more tasks from the Backlog and repeat the process.\n\t_______________________________\n\n\nA certificate is not necessary, but can be a stand-out item on a resume.

Internet Explorer also supports this feature (beginning with IE 8), also accessed from View > Page Style. Chrome requires an extension to use the feature (as of version 48). The web page can also provide its own user interface to let the user switch styles.\n\nAn example: specifying the alternative stylesheets\n\nThe alternate stylesheets are commonly specified using a <link> element with rel=\"alternate stylesheet\" and title=\"...\" attributes. For example:\n\n<link href=\"reset.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">\n\n<link href=\"default.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" title=\"Default Style\">\n<link href=\"fancy.css\" rel=\"alternate stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" title=\"Fancy\">\n<link href=\"basic.css\" rel=\"alternate stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" title=\"Basic\">\n\nIn this example, the styles \"Default Style\", \"Fancy\", and \"Basic\" will be listed in the Page Style submenu, with \"Default Style\" pre-selected. When the user selects a different style, the page will immediately be re-rendered using that style sheet.\n\nNo matter what style is selected, the rules from the reset.css stylesheet will always be applied.\nTry it out\n\nWorking examples are here:\nhttps://media.prod.mdn.mozit.cloud/samples/cssref/altstyles/index.html\n\nThere is more to this article at:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Alternative_style_sheets",

      "answer":"All of this addresses the loading of documents and how they affect the main document.\n\nFrom:https://javascript.info/script-async-defer\n\n\nDEFER:\n\nThe defer attribute tells the browser not to wait for \nthe script. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, \nbuild DOM. The script loads “in the background”, and then runs when the \nDOM is fully built.\n\nHere’s the same example as above, but with defer:\n\nASYNC\n\nTheasync attribute is somewhat like \ndefer. It also makes the script non-blocking. But it has important differences in the behavior.\n\nThe async attribute means that a script is completely independent:\n\n    The browser doesn’t block on \n    async\n     scripts (like \n    defer\n    ).\n    Other scripts don’t wait for \n    async\n     scripts, and \n    async\n     scripts don’t wait for them.\n    DOMContentLoaded\n     and async scripts don’t wait for each other:\n        DOMContentLoaded\n         may happen both before an async script (if an async script finishes loading after the page is complete)\n        …or after an async script (if an async script is short or was in HTTP-cache)\n\n    <p>...content before scripts...</p>\n\n    <scrip/t>\n      document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => alert(\"DOM ready!\"));\n    </scrip/t>\n\n    <scrip/t async src=\"https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js\"></scrip/t>\n    <scrip/t async src=\"https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/small.js\"></scrip/t>\n\n    <p>...content after scripts...</p>\n\n\n\nThe following examples come from: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/html-preload-prefetch\n\n\n    \nPRELOAD\n\n<p>...content before script...</p>\n\n<scrip/t defer src=\"https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js?speed=1\"></scrip/t>\n\n<!-- visible immediately -->\n<p>...content after script...</p>\n\n\nIn other words:\n\n    Scripts with \n    defer\n     never block the page.\n    Scripts with \n    defer\n     always execute when the DOM is ready (but before \n    DOMContentLoaded\n     event).\n\nPreloading JavaScript resources is done differently. This example, taken from this Google Developers article on preloading, shows this:\nindex.html\n\n<link rel=\"preload\" href=\"used-later.js\" as=\"scrip/t\">\n<!-- ... -->\n<scrip/t>\n  var usedLaterScript = document.createElement('script');\n  usedLaterScript.src = 'used-later.js';\n  document.body.appendChild(usedLaterScript);\n</scrip/t>\n\n\n\nPREFETCH\n\nPrefetching works similarly to preloading. The difference is that, \nwhen prefetching a resource, the browser considers the resource to be \nlow priority. This means that the resource or asset will load a bit \nlater. Because of this, prefetching is usually implemented with \nresources that are not required initially, but are used at a later \npoint.\n\nTo implement prefectching in your HTML page, change the value of \nrel to \"prefetching.\n\nindex.html\n<link\n  rel=\"prefetch\"\n  as=\"style\"\n  onload=\"this.rel = 'stylesheet'\"\n  href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:100,900|Material+Icons'>\n\n",

      "answer":"This comes from a nice article describing what callbacks are:\nhttps://codeburst.io/javascript-what-the-heck-is-a-callback-aba4da2deced\n\nWhat is a Callback?\n\nSimply put: A callback is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing — hence the name ‘call back’.\n\nMore complexly put: In JavaScript, functions are objects. Because of this, functions can take functions as arguments, and can be returned by other functions. Functions that do this are called higher-order functions. Any function that is passed as an argument is called a callback function.\n\nAn aexample:\nfunction first(){\n  // Simulate a code delay\n  setTimeout( function(){\n    console.log(1);\n  }, 500 );\n}function second(){\n  console.log(2);\n}first();\nsecond();\n\n\nfirst();\nsecond();\n// 2\n// 1\n\n\nAnd from a site called callbackhell.com:\n\nWhat is \"callback hell\"?\n\nAsynchronous JavaScript, or JavaScript that uses callbacks, is hard to get right intuitively. A lot of code ends up looking like this:\n\nfs.readdir(source, function (err, files) {\n  if (err) {\n    console.log('Error finding files: ' + err)\n  } else {\n    files.forEach(function (filename, fileIndex) {\n      console.log(filename)\n      gm(source + filename).size(function (err, values) {\n        if (err) {\n          console.log('Error identifying file size: ' + err)\n        } else {\n          console.log(filename + ' : ' + values)\n          aspect = (values.width / values.height)\n          widths.forEach(function (width, widthIndex) {\n            height = Math.round(width / aspect)\n            console.log('resizing ' + filename + 'to ' + height + 'x' + height)\n            this.resize(width, height).write(dest + 'w' + width + '_' + filename, function(err) {\n              if (err) console.log('Error writing file: ' + err)\n            })\n          }.bind(this))\n        }\n      })\n    })\n  }\n})\n\nSee the pyramid shape and all the }) at the end? Eek! This is affectionately known as callback hell.\n\nThe cause of callback hell is when people try to write JavaScript in a way where execution happens visually from top to bottom. Lots of people make this mistake! In other languages like C, Ruby or Python there is the expectation that whatever happens on line 1 will finish before the code on line 2 starts running and so on down the file. As you will learn, JavaScript is different. \n\nHow do I fix callback hell?\n\nCallback hell is caused by poor coding practices. Luckily writing better code isn't that hard!\n\nYou only need to follow three rules:\n1. Keep your code shallow\n\nHere is some messy browser JavaScript that uses browser-request to make an AJAX request to a server:\n\nvar form = document.querySelector('form')\nform.onsubmit = function (submitEvent) {\n  var name = document.querySelector('input').value\n  request({\n    uri: \"http://example.com/upload\",\n    body: name,\n    method: \"POST\"\n  }, function (err, response, body) {\n    var statusMessage = document.querySelector('.status')\n    if (err) return statusMessage.value = err\n    statusMessage.value = body\n  })\n}\n\n\n2. Modularize\n\nThis is the most important part: Anyone is capable of creating modules (aka libraries). To quote Isaac Schlueter (of the node.js project): \"Write small modules that each do one thing, and assemble them into other modules that do a bigger thing. You can't get into callback hell if you don't go there.\" \n\n\n3. Handle every single error\n\nThere are different types of errors: syntax errors caused by the programmer (usually caught when you try to first run the program), runtime errors caused by the programmer (the code ran but had a bug that caused something to mess up), platform errors caused by things like invalid file permissions, hard drive failure, no network connection etc. This section is only meant to address this last class of errors.\n\nThe first two rules are primarily about making your code readable, but this one is about making your code stable. When dealing with callbacks you are by definition dealing with tasks that get dispatched, go off and do something in the background, and then complete successfully or abort due to failure. Any experienced developer will tell you that you can never know when these errors happen, so you have to plan on them always happening.\n\nWith callbacks the most popular way to handle errors is the Node.js style where the first argument to the callback is always reserved for an error.\n\n var fs = require('fs')\n\n fs.readFile('/Does/not/exist', handleFile)\n\n function handleFile (error, file) {\n   if (error) return console.error('Uhoh, there was an error', error)\n   // otherwise, continue on and use `file` in your code\n }\n\n\n",

      "answer":"Content Security Policy (CSP) is an HTTP header that allows site operators fine-grained control over where resources on their site can be loaded from. The use of this header is the best method to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Due to the difficulty in retrofitting CSP into existing websites, CSP is mandatory for all new websites and is strongly recommended for all existing high-risk sites.\n\nThe primary benefit of CSP comes from disabling the use of unsafe inline JavaScript. Inline JavaScript – either reflected or stored – means that improperly escaped user-inputs can generate code that is interpreted by the web browser as JavaScript. By using CSP to disable inline JavaScript, you can effectively eliminate almost all XSS attacks against your site.",

      "answer":"This excerpt comes from an answer by Crescent Fresh on stackoverflow.com:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/1688293\n\nEvent bubbling provides the foundation for event delegation in \nbrowsers. Now you can bind an event handler to a single parent element, \nand that handler will get executed whenever the event occurs on any of its child nodes (and any of their children in turn). This is event delegation. Here's an example of it in practice\n\n\n<ul onclick=\"alert(event.type + '!')\">\n    <li>One</li>\n    <li>Two</li>\n    <li>Three</li>\n</ul>\n\n\nWith that example if you were to click on any of the child \n<li>\n nodes, you would see an alert of \n\"click!\"\n, even though there is no click handler bound to the \n<li>\n you clicked on. If we bound \nonclick=\"...\"\n to each \n<li>\n you would get the same effect.\n\n\nSo what's the benefit?\n\n\nImagine you now have a need to dynamically add new \n<li>\n items to the above list via DOM manipulation:\n\n\nvar newLi = document.createElement('li');\nnewLi.innerHTML = 'Four';\nmyUL.appendChild(newLi);\n\n\nWithout using event delegation you would have to \"rebind\" the \n\"onclick\"\n event handler to the new \n<li>\n element, in order for it to act the same way as its siblings. With event delegation you don't need to do anything. Just add the new \n<li>\n to the list and you're done.\n\n\nThis is absolutely fantastic for web apps with event handlers bound \nto many elements, where new elements are dynamically created and/or \nremoved in the DOM. With event delegation the number of event bindings \ncan be drastically decreased by moving them to a common parent element, \nand code that dynamically creates new elements on the fly can be \ndecoupled from the logic of binding their event handlers.\n\n",

      "answer":"Part of a good CSS architecture is file organization. A monolithic file is fine for solo developers or very small projects. For large projects—sites with multiple layouts and content types, or multiple brands under the same design umbrella—it’s smarter to use a modular approach and split your CSS across multiple files.\n\nSplitting your CSS across files makes it easier to parcel tasks out to teams. One developer can work on typography-related styles, while another can focus on developing grid components. Teams can split work sensibly and increase overall productivity.\n\nHere’s a dummy css structure:\n\nreset.css: reset and normalization styles; minimal color, border, or font-related declarations\ntypography.css: font faces, weights, line heights, sizes, and styles for headings and body text\nlayouts.css: styles that manage page layouts and segments, including grids\nforms.css: styles for form controls and labels\nlists.css: list-specific styles\ntables.css: table-specific styles\ncarousel.css: styles required for carousel components\naccordion.css: styles for accordion components",

      "answer":"Functional programming was introduced in LISP over 60 years ago (1958).\nCurrent popular functional programming languages are Pascal, Scala and Clojure.\nFunctional programming works really well for distributed computing (multiple machines interacting with data) and parallelism (machines working on the same data at the same time).\n    A strong focus on simplicity concerning data and functions is a characteristic of Functional Programming languages\n    The separation of concerns - data and functions - create clarity\n    Pure functions are a staple of functional programming\n    All objects created in functional programming are immutable\n    Sharing state is not allowed\n\nMain goals are to achieve code that is:\n\n    Clear and understandable\n    Easy to extend\n    Easy to maintain\n    Memory efficient\n    D.R.Y.\n\nPure Functions\nRules for Pure Functions\n\n    Referential Transparency - functions that always return the same output given the same input\n    Can not modify anything outside of the functions (side effects)\n\nQualities of Pure Functions\n\n    Only one Task\n    return statement\n    No shared State\n    Immutable State\n    Composable\n    Predictable\n\nCan the average program only have Pure functions? No. There will always be a certain amount of interacting/side effects in any program. The key, as far as Functional Programming is concerned, is to organize the code in a way to isolate these side effects.\n\n\nIdempotence\n\nThis is the concept of a function doing exactly what is expected every time it is called. The function may or may not be Pure (it might have side effects) but it still performs the same action and returns the same result every time it is called with the same variables. In addition, an idempotent function can call itself repeatedly and still return the same output as if it did not call itself\n\nThis concept is especially valuable for parallel and distributed computing in that it makes the code predictable and consistent\n\nImperative vs Declarative\n\nImperative: Telling the machine what to do and how to do it.\n\nDeclarative: Telling the machine what to do and what you want to have happen, but not how to do it. This will generally still be compiled by something more imperative, but the engineers interaction with the code can be less complex with declarative functions Functional Programming helps us be more declarative. \n\n\nCurrying\n\nCurrying is the technique of reducing functions to a very basic utility with no more than one argument that can then be linked together to perform larger operations. This can reduce system demands and control complexity.\n\nPartial Application\n\nPartial Application is the technique of partially filling a functions variables/ actions so the function can be reused with less system demand because it is partially saved in memory. The function would expect the rest of the variables on the second call. This can also create cleaner, more obvious code while eliminating repeated identical variable input.\n\nMemoization (Cache)\n\nMemoization is the act of storing the output of a function in memory to be read multiple times. This keeps the data available while avoiding running the same function and perimeters multiple times.\n\nCompose & Pipe\n\nComposabilty is a system design principle that handles different components directly interacting. Essentially, a process for imputing different functions and running them in various combinations. This is somewhat like a function assembly line. The last function fires first with the output feeding the previous function, whose output feeds the previous function, etc.\n\nPipe is the same as compose, but it runs the functions in reverse order. The first function fires first with the output feeding the next function, whose output feeds the next function, etc.\n\nArity\n\nArity is the number of parameters a function accepts. In Functional Programming, an arity of one or two is desired.\n\nBringing All of This Together\n\nBelow uses the principles of Functional Programming to create a working shopping cart.\n\n// Setup the user\nconst user = {\n    name: 'Kim',\n    active: true,\n    cart: [],\n    purchases: []\n}\n\n// The history1 variable will store user each step to keep a record\nconst history1 = [];\n\n// Setup compose functionality\nconst compose = (f, g) = & gt;\n(...args) = & gt;\nf(g(...args))\n\n// Use compose to set up the assembly line\nconst purchaseItem = (...fns) = & gt;\nfns.reduce(compose);\n\n// Fill the assembly line\npurchaseItem(\n    emptyUserCart,\n    buyItem,\n    applyTaxToItems,\n    addItemToCart\n)(user, {\n    name: 'laptop',\n    price: 50\n});\n\n// Record the initial user data,\n// update the cart and then return a copy\n// of the user object with the updated info\nfunction addItemToCart(user, item) {\n    history1.push(user)\n    const updatedCart = user.cart.concat(item)\n    return Object.assign({}, user, {\n        cart: updatedCart\n    });\n}\n\n// Record the initial user data and\n// then return the cart with the updated amount\nfunction applyTaxToItems(user) {\n    history1.push(user)\n    const {\n        cart\n    } = user;\n    const taxRate = 1.3;\n    const updatedCart = cart.map(item = & gt; {\n        return {\n            name: item.name,\n            price: item.price * taxRate\n        }\n    })\n    return Object.assign({}, user, {\n        cart: updatedCart\n    });\n}\n\n// Record the initial user data and\n// then return a copy of the object with the item added to the cart\nfunction buyItem(user) {\n    history1.push(user)\n    const itemsInCart = user.cart;\n    return Object.assign({}, user, {\n        purchases: itemsInCart\n    });\n}\n\n// Record the initial user data and\n// then return an empty copy of the object.\nfunction emptyUserCart(user) {\n    history1.push(user)\n    return Object.assign({}, user, {\n        cart: []\n    });\n}",

This comes with Node.js and is used to manage dependencies, like libraries and components. Various tools can be easily installed in projects (or even installed globally in Node) and NPM facilitates this. \n\nThere will be package.json that logs all of these dependencies. This log include both core dependencies that will be used in production as well as those that are specific to the development environment. This is used if we wish to install all of our dependencies with a few words in a command line: \n\n\t\tnpm install\n\n\tThe package manager will then download and install everything for us. This can be done anytime from any computer with an internet connection.\n\nAn alternative to NPM is Yarn. This does the same basic things that NPM does, but has a few benefits, though these may be less now after some improvements to NPM.

      "answer":"Object Oriented Programming\n\nBenefits of OOP\n\nClear and understandable\nEasy to extend\nEasy to Maintain\nMemory efficient\nAdheres to \"D.R.Y.\" philosophy (Don't Repeat Yourself)\n\nFour Pillars of OOP\n\nEncapsulation - neat & clean self-contained packages that can interact with each other\nAbstraction - Hiding the complexity to make interaction with the code basic, intuitive and complete.\nInheritance - Avoiding duplicated code by sharing methods and properties.\nPolymorphism - Ability to call a single method on different objects and have the method function different based on the object or situation.\n\nUsing encapsulation these objects offer complete units ready to be used as needed. The properties like name and weapon makeup the state of the object while the methods like attack are there to affect the state of the object.\n\n\nTake this very basic example:\n\nconst elf = {\n    name: 'Orwell',\n    weapon: 'bow',\n    attack() {\n        return 'attack with ' + elf.weapon\n    }\n}\n\nconst elf2 = {\n    name: 'Sam',\n    weapon: 'Sword',\n    attack() {\n        return 'attack with ' + elf.weapon\n    }\n}\n\n\nThe problem with the objects above is they repeat code and, presumably, there will be more of these. Duplicating this many times is time-consuming and inefficient at runtime.\n\nThe concept of \"Factory Functions\", or functions that build objects, can make the objects above cleaner and more efficient to build.\n\n// Factory function - build elf objects\nfunction createElf(name, weapon) {\n    return {\n        name: name,\n        weapon: weapon,\n        attack() {\n            return 'attack with ' + weapon\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nconst peter = createElf('Peter', 'Stones');\nconsole.log(peter.attack()); // RESULT: \"attack with Stones\"\n\nconst sam = createElf('Sam', 'Fire');\nconsole.log(sam.attack()); // RESULT: \"attack with Fire\"\n\n\n\nThis can be improved to a more complete OOP approach. Using a super-class and then extending this to create sub-classes allows for sharing of common functions between all objects created, while each sub-class object can share functions and properties unique to their group\n\n\nFor this, you need to call the super-class' constructor and pass the needed variables. This is done through the super(props) function.\n\n// Set the super-class\nclass Character {\n    constructor(name, weapon) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.weapon = weapon;\n    }\n    attack() {\n        return 'attack with ' + this.weapon\n    }\n}\n\n// Extend the super-class\nclass Elf extends Character {\n    constructor(name, weapon, type) {\n        super(name, weapon, type);\n\n        // Add properties unique to this sub-class, but also unique variations for each instance of this sub-class\n        this.type = type\n    }\n}\n\nclass Ogre extends Character {\n    constructor(name, weapon, color) {\n        super(name, weapon);\n\n        // Add properties unique to this sub-class, but also unique variations for each instance of this sub-class\n        this.color = color;\n    }\n\n    // Add functions unique to this sub-class and shared by all in the sub-class\n    makeFort() {\n        return 'The strongest fort in the world has been made'\n    }\n}\n\nconst peter = new Elf('Peter', 'Stones', 'Wood Elf');\nconsole.log(peter.name); // RESULT: \"Peter\"\nconsole.log(peter.type); // RESULT: \"Wood Elf\"\nconsole.log(peter.attack()); // RESULT: \"attack with Stones\"\n\nconst sam = new Elf('Sam', 'Fire', 'House Elf');\nconsole.log(sam.name); // RESULT: \"Sam\"\nconsole.log(sam.type); // RESULT: \"House Elf\"\nconsole.log(sam.attack()); // RESULT: \"attack with Fire\"\n\nconst shrek = new Ogre('Shrek', 'club', 'green');\nconsole.log(shrek.name); // RESULT: \"Shrek\"\nconsole.log(shrek.attack()); // RESULT: \"attack with club\"\nconsole.log(shrek.makeFort()); // RESULT: \"The strongest fort in the world has been made\"\n\n// Check for instanceOf\nconsole.log('Is Peter an instance of Elf?', peter instanceof Elf); // RESULT: true\nconsole.log('Is Sam and instance of Elf?', sam instanceof Elf); // RESULT: true\n\nconsole.log('Is Shrek an instance of Elf?', shrek instanceof Elf); // RESULT: false\nconsole.log('Is Shrek an instance of Character?', shrek instanceof Character); // RESULT: true\nconsole.log('Is Shrek an instance of Ogre?', shrek instanceof Ogre); // RESULT: true\n\n// Under the hood, JS is just creating prototype chains\nconsole.log('Is Ogre a prototype of Shrek? ', Ogre.prototype.isPrototypeOf(shrek));\nconsole.log('Is Character a prototype of Ogre? ', Character.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Ogre.prototype));\n\n\nMore detail: https://www.glassinteractive.com/javascript-cheatsheet/#oop",

      "answer":"Here are a few snippets from:\nhttps://dzone.com/articles/client-side-vs-server-side-rendering-what-to-choos\n\n\nClient-Side Rendering\n\nClient-side rendering or CSR is a different approach to how the web page is processed for display in the browser. In the CSR, the burden of compiling dynamic content and generating HTML for them is transferred to the client's browser.\n\nThis approach is powered with JavaScript frameworks and libraries like ReactJS, VueJS, and Angular. The normal flow of web page rendering for a client-side rendering scenario follows these steps:\n\n    The user sends a request to a website (usually via a browser).\n    Instead of a server, a CDN (Content Delivery Network) can be used to serve static HTML, CSS, and supporting files to the user.\n    The browser downloads the HTML and then the JS. Meanwhile, the user sees a loading symbol.\n    After the browser fetches the JS, it makes API requests via AJAX to fetch the dynamic content and processes it to render the final content.\n    After the server responds, the final content is rendered using DOM processing in the client's browser.\n\n\n\n\nServer-Side Rendering\n\nServer-side rendering or SSR is the conventional way of rendering web pages on the browser. As discussed above, the traditional way of rendering dynamic web content follows the below steps:\n\n    The user sends a request to a website (usually via a browser)\n    The server checks the resource, compiles and prepares the HTML content after traversing through server-side scripts lying within the page.\n    This compiled HTML is sent to the client’s browser for further rendering and display.\n    The browser downloads the HTML and makes the site visible to the end-user\n    The browser then downloads the Javascript (JS) and as it executes the JS, it makes the page interactive\n\nServer-side rendering\nServer-side rendering\n\nIn this process, all the burden of getting the dynamic content, converting it to HTML, and sending it to the browser is on the server. Hence, this process is called server-side rendering (SSR).This responsibility of rendering the complete HTML in advance comes with a burden on memory and processing power on the server. This increases the page load time compared to the page load time for a static site where there is no dynamic content to render.\n\n\nWhen to Use SSR & CSR\n\nDynamic Content Loading\nMachines on the client end, however, feature limited computing power. This translates into more time required to complete content rendering. Therefore, if your site involves repeated dynamic content rendering, SSR is the better choice.\n\nWeb App UX & Site UX\nCSR works best for web apps because it can help ensure that each click doesn’t take too long. When it comes to websites, however, SSR fares better than CSR because it ensures the right metadata for searching engine bots. On top of that, caching mechanisms can help speed up rendering when users navigate from one page to another.\n\n\n\nBest of Both Worlds\n\nThere are frameworks that work on a hybrid approach, such as Gatsby.\n\nWhile the first page is always loaded with SSR, it caches the other pages after the load is done so the rest of the pages are pre-rendered and cached, making it feel like you’re using a CSR approach on the subsequent pages! Check out our website, which is also built using Gatsby.\n\n",

React components can be defined by subclassing React.Component or React.PureComponent as per react official doc.\n\n\nFunctional Components\n\n    A Functional component is the simplest way to define a component in ReactJs, it’s a simple javascript function which returns a React element. Functional components are also known as stateless components.\n\n\nClass Components\n\n    A Class components are ES6 classes based Components. A component which provide more features to deal with codes. It also receives props like function components and is able to define its own states.\n    Each component in react has several life-cycle methods, which are being used from time to time.\n\n\nPure Component\n\n    As per Reacts official documentation: React.PureComponent is similar to React.Component. The difference between them is that React.Component doesn’t implement shouldComponentUpdate(), but React.PureComponent implements it with a shallow prop and state comparison.\n\n    If your React component’s render() function renders the same result given the same props and state, you can use React.PureComponent for a performance boost in some cases.\n",

      "answer":"An ID is meant to be unique to an element. This provides the ability to grab the a specific element in JS and in CSS. An ID holds a higher level of specificity in CSS, so this means it will overrule a class. Technically, it is possible to have duplicate ID's in HTML, but that is bad practice as it defeats the primary purpose of an ID, which is to be a unique identifier, and steps on the purpose of a class.\n\nClasses in HTML & CSS are a way of applying a specific rule set to one or many elements. This makes it possible to have one rule set affect any number of elements and changes to that rule set can affect them all. Classes are less specific to an element, so if a conflicting declaration exists in a rule set that has an ID, the declaration in the rule set with the ID will override the declaration with only a class.  Many classes can apply to an element at any time or even no classes at all. \n",

      "answer":"Excerpts from hacker.io:\n\nCSS was originally released in 1996 and consists of properties for adding font properties such as typeface and emphasis color of text, backgrounds, and other elements. CSS2 was released in 1998 with added styles for other media types so that it can be used for page layout designing. CSS3 was released in 1999 and presentation-style properties were added in it that allows you to build a presentation from documents.\n\nUnlike CSS2, which was comprised of a single document, CSS3 has its specifications divided into many individual modules, which makes CSS3 a whole lot easier to handle.\n\nWith CSS3, the designers can now use special fonts, like those available in Google Fonts and Typecast. Earlier, with CSS and CSS2, designers could only use “web-safe fonts” for being 100% sure to use fonts that would always display the same on every machine.\n\nWhile CSS and CSS2 had ‘simple selectors’, CSS3 calls the components as ‘a sequence of simple selectors’.\n\nCSS3 came up with some key web design considerations like rounded borders that help in rounding up the borders without any hassle. This turned out to be a huge plus point for developers who were struggling with initial versions of CSS borders.\n\nCSS3 has the capability to split text sections into multiple columns so that it can be read like a newspaper. In CSS2, the developers had difficulty because the standard was not equipped with automatically breaking the text so that it fits within a box.\n\n",

Making a website responsive means some elements will respond by adapting its size or other functionality according to the device’s screen size, typically the viewport width, through CSS media queries.\n\nFor example, making the font size smaller on smaller devices.\n\n@media (min-width: 601px) {\n\n  .my-class {\n\n    font-size: 24px;\n  }\n\n}\n\n@media (max-width: 600px) {\n\n  .my-class {\n\n    font-size: 12px;\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nA mobile-first strategy is also responsive, however, it agrees we should default and define all the styles for mobile devices, and only add specific responsive rules to other devices later. Following the previous example:\n\n.my-class {\n  font-size: 12px;\n}\n\n@media (min-width: 600px) {\n\n\n  .my-class {\n\n    font-size: 24px;\n\n  }\n\n}\n\n\nA mobile-first strategy has 2 main advantages:\n\nIt’s more performant on mobile devices since all the rules applied for them don’t have to be validated against any media queries\nIt forces to write cleaner code in respect to responsive CSS rules.",

      "answer":"From Wikipedia:\n\nIn computing, tree shaking is a dead code elimination technique that is applied when optimizing code written in ECMAScript dialects like Dart, JavaScript, or TypeScript into a single bundle that is loaded by a web browser. Rather than eliminating code that can never be executed, tree shaking starts from entry point and includes only the code that is guaranteed to be executed.[1] It is succinctly described as \"live code inclusion\".\nHistory\n\nDead code elimination in dynamic languages is a much harder problem than in static languages. The idea of a \"treeshaker\" originated in LISP[2] in the 1990s. The idea is that all possible execution flows of a program can be represented as a tree of function calls, so that functions that are never called can be eliminated.\n\nThe algorithm was applied to JavaScript in Google Closure Tools and then to Dart in the dart2js compiler also written by Google, presented by Bob Nystrom in 2012[3][4] and described by the book \"Dart in Action\" by author Chris Buckett in 2013:\n\n    When code is converted from Dart to JavaScript the compiler does 'tree shaking'. In JavaScript you have to add an entire library even if you only need it for one function, but thanks to tree shaking the Dart-derived JavaScript only includes the individual functions that you need from a library\n    — Chris Buckett\n\nThe next wave of popularity of the term is attributed to Rich Harris's Rollup project[5] developed in 2015.\nRelation to ECMAScript 6 modules\n\nThe popularity of tree shaking in JavaScript is based on the fact that in distinction from CommonJS modules, ECMAScript 6 module loading is static and thus the whole dependency tree can be deduced by statically parsing the syntax tree. Thus tree shaking becomes an easy problem. However, tree shaking does not only apply at the import/export level: it can also work at the statement level, depending on the implementation.[citation needed] ",

      "answer":"It is the process of generating intermediate frames between two images. This term comes form animation and is not often used in CSS. It is still a good idea to understand the term and how it relates to CSS animations\n\nIn CSS3, Transforms (matrix, translate, rotate, scale) create tweening.\n\n\nAn answer from Chris Camaratta via StackOverflow.com highlights the above:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/44536178\n\n\nTweening is not a term that's used too often in CSS. As you discovered it has its roots in computer animation. Rather than telling the program exactly how to render each frame, the animator would tell the program what position the objects are in at two \"keyframes\" and the program would figure out how to transition the objects between those two points.\n\nIn CSS we usually use the term \"animate\", but the concepts are the same. MDN has a good introduction here. This simple example (from the article) demonstrates how to make a <p> element slide in from off the right edge of the browser window:\n\np {\n  animation-duration: 3s;\n  animation-name: slidein;\n}\n\n@keyframes slidein {\n  from {\n    margin-left: 100%;\n    width: 300%; \n  }\n\n  to {\n    margin-left: 0%;\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n",

      "answer":"This question is sometimes asked because it is more of an intermediate to advanced topic, given that it deals with both how things are layered, how an element's parent affects this and how the position property setting can change things.\n\n\tHere are the basics to know:\n\t- z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky).\n\n\t- Elements usually stack with the items that are lower in the DOM appearing on top. z-index can change that for an element using a integer. The higher the number, the higher it goes on the element stack.\n\n\t- Understanding how the parent-child relationship works is very important for understanding how z-index will affect the elements. If element A has children, but element B sits on top of it, then no child element A can ever be higher than element B. No matter how high we make the z-index setting. \n\n\t- You can animate z-index, but it is either behind or in front of an element. It will not transition from one to the other. \n\n\tAn example that can be dropped into an online editor like https://codepen.io/pen/ :\n\n\n\t\tCSS\n\t\t\tdiv {\n\t\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\t\tbackground: black;\n\t\t\tcolor: white;\n\t\t\twidth: 100%;\n\t\t\ttop: 35%;\n\t\t\ttext-align: center;\n\t\t\tpadding: 1em\n\t\t}\n\n\t\timg {\n\t\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\t\tleft: 25%;\n\t\t\ttop: 0;\n\t\t\tz-index: -1;\n\t\t\tmargin: 0 auto;\n\t\t}\n\n\n\t\tHTML\n\t\t    <div><h1>Toggle the image's z-index property to watch it go backwards and forwards.</h1>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<img src=\"https://source.unsplash.com/random\" width=\"50%\">\n",

      "answer":"This type of question might be general like the first one or specific like the second. In either case, it is good to have a firm understanding of a set of industry-accepted best practices. \n\nThe SOLID principles are a good place to start.Here is a descriptive excerpt from Wikipedia:\n\"SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable.\"\n\n\"The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by American software engineer and instructor Robert C. Martin. Though they apply to any object-oriented design, the SOLID principles can also form a core philosophy for methodologies such as agile development or adaptive software development.\"\n\nHere are the five core principles:\n\tSingle-responsibility principle - Every class, module or function should be responsible for only one part of the app's functionality. That responsibility should be narrow. the class, module or function should completely handle that responsibility within.\n\n\t\tOne example of this Single-responsibility principle is a function that handles displaying sports scores. So, it gathers the content and then creates the HTML. One job is substance, the content, and the other is more cosmetic, the HTML. That means the function covers two responsibilities. Single-Responsibility says these should be two separate functions.\n\n\tOpen–closed principle - Classes, modules and functions should be open for extension, but closed for modification. This basically means that we should plan ahead for the need to add new functionality without needing to rewrite the original,\n\n\tFor example, here, we can use this to shop for a car.\n\n\tclass CarShopping {\n\t  // Some other helper functions …\n\n\t  carsAvailable() {\n\n\t  \tconst response = \"Data from an API.\"\n\t    return response;\n\t  }\n\n\t  totalCostCalculator() {\n\t  \t//...code\n\t  }\n\t //...other helpful functionality\n\t}\n\n\tThis will work for a car search, but if we later decide to also shop for a utility truck or a boat? We would need to go back and directly add that functionality. This is modifying the class. Instead we can just plan ahead a bit and make it so we can extend the core functionality.\n\n\tclass vehicleShopping {\n\n\t  financingCalculator() {\n\t  \t//...code\n\t  }\n\n\t //...other helpful functionality\n\t}\n\n\n\tclass CarShopping extends vehicleShopping{\n\n\t  carsAvailable() {\n\n\t  \tconst response = \"Data from an API.\"\n\t    return response;\n\t  }\n\n\t}\n\n\tclass TruckShopping extends vehicleShopping{\n\n\t  trucksAvailable() {\n\n\t  \tconst response = \"Data from an API.\"\n\t    return response;\n\t  }\n\n\t}\n\n\tclass BoatShopping extends vehicleShopping{\n\n\t  trucksAvailable() {\n\n\t  \tconst response = \"Data from an API.\"\n\t    return response;\n\t  }\n\n\t}\n\n\n\n\tLiskov substitution principle - Objects should be replaceable with instances without altering the use (see also design by contract). Basically, if we make an instance, it should be able to be used like any other related instance.\n\n\t\tA great example here is Maysara Alhindi's StackOverflow example here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/44913313\n\n\t\tpublic class Bird{\n\t\t    public void fly(){}\n\t\t}\n\t\tpublic class Duck extends Bird{}\n\n\n\t\tThe duck can fly because of it is a bird, but what about this:\n\n\n\t\tpublic class Ostrich extends Bird{}\n\n\n\t\tAn ostrich is a bird, But it can't fly, Ostrich class is a subtype of class Bird, But it can't use the fly method, that means that we are breaking LSP principle.\n\t\t\n\t\tHere is a better way:\n\n\t\tpublic class Bird{\n\t\t}\n\t\tpublic class FlyingBirds extends Bird{\n\t\t    public void fly(){}\n\t\t}\n\t\tpublic class Duck extends FlyingBirds{}\n\t\tpublic class Ostrich extends Bird{} \n\n\n\n\tInterface segregation principle - This is basically the Single-Responsibility principle, but applied to an interfaces. JavaScript does not have official interfaces like other programming languages, but how we access an object can be considered an interface. The goal here is just to make sure the methods on an object are sing-purposed. \n\n\n\tDependency inversion principle - For JavaScript, the goal here is to make sure high level modules don't depend upon low level modules. Like ISP above, examples for this are always converted to TypeScrupt because the interface language feature there, so it is not very helpful for JavaScript. In general, the goal is to make sure that we don't have one module or class that can not work because it requires another module or class. This can be especially bad if there is a chain of dependencies like this.\n\n\tThis is a good read on the subject: https://carstenbehrens.com/dependency-inversion-principle%20copy/\n\n",

There are a variety of uses for something like this, including an app as simple as a to-do list, which also takes advantage of local storage.\n\n<h2> To-Do List </h2>\n<ul contenteditable=\"true\">\n  <li> Break mechanical cab driver. </li>\n  <li> Drive to abandoned factory\n  <li> Watch video of self </li>\n</ul>\nAttributes\n\nrequire to mention the form field is required\nautofocus puts the cursor on the input field\n",

      "answer":"The following are excerpts from an article on webaim.org:\nhttps://webaim.org/techniques/css/invisiblecontent/\n\nThere are occasional instances where content should be made available to screen reader users but hidden from sighted users. In the vast majority cases, content that is available visually should be available to screen reader users, and vice versa.\n\ntext-indent: -10000px;\n\nThis approach moves the content to the left 10000 pixels - thus off the visible screen. Screen readers will still read text with this style.\n\nHowever, if a link, form control, or other focusable element is given this style, the element would be focusable, but not visible on the page—sighted keyboard users would likely be confused. This approach may be a viable option if the element does not contain navigable elements, though better techniques are available.\nAbsolutely positioning content off-screen\n\nThe following are the recommended styles for visually hiding content that will be read by a screen reader.\n.sr-only {\nposition:absolute;\nleft:-10000px;\ntop:auto;\nwidth:1px;\nheight:1px;\noverflow:hidden;\n}\n\nThe .sr-only CSS class (\"sr-only\" meaning \"screen reader only\", though the class name does not really matter) should then be referenced from within the tag of the element being hidden, as shown:\n<div class=\"sr-only\">This text is hidden.</div>\n\nSighted users will not see the hidden content at all—it will be hidden well to the left of the visible browser window. Because it is still part of the page content, screen readers will read it.\n\nCSS clip\nThis fairly modern technique will hide or clip content that does not fit into a 1-pixel visible area.

      "answer":"When you have specified a width on the object that you have applied margin: 0 auto to, the object will sit centrally within its parent container. Specifying auto as the second parameter basically tells the browser to automatically determine the left and right margins itself, which it does by setting them equally. It guarantees that the left and right margins will be set to the same size. The first parameter 0 indicates that the top and bottom margins will both be set to 0.\n\nmargin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\nTherefore, to give you an example, if the parent is 100px and the child is 50px, then the auto property will determine that there’s 50px of free space to share between margin-left and margin-right:\n\nvar freeSpace = 100 - 50;\nvar equalShare = freeSpace / 2;\n\nWhich would give:\n\nmargin-left:25;\nmargin-right:25;",

      "answer":"Something that has almost always come up for me is the way you size your text, mainly focused on the units you use. You can of course use pixels (px), but there’s also em, rem, %, vs and vh, along with a few others. Some people still don’t like using pixels, but browsers have improved and they’re generally handled pretty well.\n\nDefining your font sizes in em allows you to change the size of your text based on the size defined at a higher level. For example, if a container has specified a font-size of 2em, and you specify a font-size of 2em on an element inside that container, that element has an effective font-size of 4em! However, this can be a little confusing as you might not always see the size you expect!\n\n.container {\n    font-size: 2em;\n}\n\n.container > p {\n    font-size: 2em; /* this is 2em x 2em = 4em! */\n}\n\nThe rem unit was created to remedy that confusion. It scales well in the browser, just like em and px, but it uses a base size. From that, all further rem values are calculated. For example, if your base rem value is equal to 16px, then 1rem will always be equal to 16px, 2rem will always be equal to 32px, and so on.\n\nNote: While I’ve explained these units using font-sizes, the same rules apply to any dimensions where you use px, em or rem.",

A simple explanation can go a long way, even if there was a bad situation and we can speak to how we learned from it.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with wanting to make more money or move up in role or even just find a culture that meshes better with our values, work ethic and/or future goals. We just need to give a brief reasoning that includes our thoughts surrounding big moves, our steps to work with our current employer before making th e moves and how those decisions ended up being good or, perhaps, lessons that we learned from those that did not.\n\nUltimately, we don't want to lie or give the impression we are trying to cover anything up. There are always reasons and many of them are good reasons. Taking advantage of opportunities for personal or professional advancement are definitely good reasons. On the other side, some reasons are lessons that are part of our growth.\n",

We need an answer with a bit of substantive personal perspective mixed in with some praise of the company for specific areas we genuinely like.\n\nA brief outline of a possible approach:\n\n\n- Look them up on https://www.glassdoor.com. Read reviews and be able to tie some of the good things said to the answer.\n\n- Find technology they are using that can feed a desire to learn new things.\n\n- Look through their website and see what blogs they might have, see what their history is and what future plans might be. Relate one or two things to an skill or experience you offer.\n\n- Web search for the company and even the people listed as part of the company on the website.

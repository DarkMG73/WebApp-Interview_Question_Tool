            answer:
              "A Promise is basically a placeholder for the results of a request. We can then use handlers based on the eventual success or failure of the request. Promises allow values to be returned much like synchronous methods, just not immediately. In the interim, the Promise, acting as the placeholder, allow the program to move on and will then provide the results of the request whenever they are ready.\n\nA Promise is always either:\n\n    pending: This is the default state. No value is ready nor has anything been rejected.\n    fulfilled: This means the request was completed successfully and the results will be returned.\n    rejected: As it sounds, the operation failed. This will return a reason for the rejection.\n\nA few approaches to handle the results of Promises, we can either chain then() methods with a catch() or use Async/Await. Note: If using Async/Await, it is a good idea to wrap it in a try-catch block to handle a possible rejection.",

            answer:
              'From Wikipedia:\n\nIn computing, tree shaking is a dead code elimination technique that is applied when optimizing code written in ECMAScript dialects like Dart, JavaScript, or TypeScript into a single bundle that is loaded by a web browser. Rather than eliminating code that can never be executed, tree shaking starts from entry point and includes only the code that is guaranteed to be executed.[1] It is succinctly described as "live code inclusion".\nHistory\n\nDead code elimination in dynamic languages is a much harder problem than in static languages. The idea of a "treeshaker" originated in LISP[2] in the 1990s. The idea is that all possible execution flows of a program can be represented as a tree of function calls, so that functions that are never called can be eliminated.\n\nThe algorithm was applied to JavaScript in Google Closure Tools and then to Dart in the dart2js compiler also written by Google, presented by Bob Nystrom in 2012[3][4] and described by the book "Dart in Action" by author Chris Buckett in 2013:\n\n    When code is converted from Dart to JavaScript the compiler does \'tree shaking\'. In JavaScript you have to add an entire library even if you only need it for one function, but thanks to tree shaking the Dart-derived JavaScript only includes the individual functions that you need from a library\n    — Chris Buckett\n\nThe next wave of popularity of the term is attributed to Rich Harris\'s Rollup project[5] developed in 2015.\nRelation to ECMAScript 6 modules\n\nThe popularity of tree shaking in JavaScript is based on the fact that in distinction from CommonJS modules, ECMAScript 6 module loading is static and thus the whole dependency tree can be deduced by statically parsing the syntax tree. Thus tree shaking becomes an easy problem. However, tree shaking does not only apply at the import/export level: it can also work at the statement level, depending on the implementation.[citation needed] ',

              "A clip from:\nhttps://www.katalon.com/resources-center/blog/ci-cd-introduction/\n\n\nCI/CD is the acronym for the combined practices of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). CI/CD practices are currently the most widely accepted choice to shorten software development and delivery cycle time.\n\n\nWhat is Continuous Integration?\n\nIn a CI practice, developers build, run, and test code on their own workstations before committing code to the version control repository. After changes are made to the repository, a chain of events is put into motion. A typical first step in this chain is to build the latest version of source code. If the build is successful, unit tests are executed. If unit testing succeeds, the build is deployed to test environments where system tests are performed (usually using automated tests). The team is notified about the status of this process, and a report is delivered to provide details, such as build number, defects, and the number of tests.\n\n\nWhat is Continuous Delivery?\n\nCD makes it possible to release builds to the production environment when needed. Allowing the team to deploy at will, CD effectively reduces time to market.\n\nBefore deploying software to production, the CD process includes performing automated system testing, unit testing (including API testing and load testing), and integration testing. The steps from CI to CD are usually completed automatically, including automated testing at the unit, integration, and system levels. As tests can fail at any level and environment, CI/CD must include a feedback channel to quickly report failures to developers.",

"I am a hard worker" followed up with how teammates always know, perhaps even commented, that we would get the job done and meet deadlines. Perhaps a bit about how some colleagues have become good friends. Maybe a little highlighting of how a boss liked to throw complicated or new things at us because he or she knew how well we can handle ourselves. This will all, of course, be personal and unique, but the general idea is just to showcase the positive affects that our personality, work ethic and passion have had on the people we worked with and the companies we worked for.\n\n\n',

              'This question is sometimes asked because it is more of an intermediate to advanced topic, given that it deals with both how things are layered, how an element\'s parent affects this and how the position property setting can change things.\n\n\tHere are the basics to know:\n\t- z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky).\n\n\t- Elements usually stack with the items that are lower in the DOM appearing on top. z-index can change that for an element using a integer. The higher the number, the higher it goes on the element stack.\n\n\t- Understanding how the parent-child relationship works is very important for understanding how z-index will affect the elements. If element A has children, but element B sits on top of it, then no child element A can ever be higher than element B. No matter how high we make the z-index setting. \n\n\t- You can animate z-index, but it is either behind or in front of an element. It will not transition from one to the other. \n\n\tAn example that can be dropped into an online editor like https://codepen.io/pen/ :\n\n\n\t\tCSS\n\t\t\tdiv {\n\t\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\t\tbackground: black;\n\t\t\tcolor: white;\n\t\t\twidth: 100%;\n\t\t\ttop: 35%;\n\t\t\ttext-align: center;\n\t\t\tpadding: 1em\n\t\t}\n\n\t\timg {\n\t\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\t\tleft: 25%;\n\t\t\ttop: 0;\n\t\t\tz-index: -1;\n\t\t\tmargin: 0 auto;\n\t\t}\n\n\n\t\tHTML\n\t\t    <div><h1>Toggle the image\'s z-index property to watch it go backwards and forwards.</h1>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random" width="50%">\n',

The use of this header is the best method to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Due to the difficulty in retrofitting CSP into existing websites, CSP is mandatory for all new websites and is strongly recommended for all existing high-risk sites.\n\nThe primary benefit of CSP comes from disabling the use of unsafe inline JavaScript. Inline JavaScript – either reflected or stored – means that improperly escaped user-inputs can generate code that is interpreted by the web browser as JavaScript. By using CSP to disable inline JavaScript, you can effectively eliminate almost all XSS attacks against your site.",

We need to articulate how strengths and be prepared for a reply that challenges this, perhaps like "Everyone does that...", or similar. This part of the interview is not really about our abilities with specific technologies, but more about how we make people around us better, how we have a strong positive impact on teams and how we will not just write the code that is needed, but use our passion, soft skills, and any other personal and professional traits to move projects and teams forward.

              'From Wikipedia.org:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing\n\nA/B testing (also known as bucket testing or split-run testing) is a user experience research methodology. [1] A/B tests consist of a randomized experiment with two variants, A and B.[2][3] It includes application of statistical hypothesis testing or "two-sample hypothesis testing" as used in the field of statistics. A/B testing is a way to compare two versions of a single variable, typically by testing a subject\'s response to variant A against variant B, and determining which of the two variants is more effective.[4] \n\n\nHere is a nice excerpt from this article:\nhttps://crossbrowsertesting.com/blog/visual-testing/ab-testing-screenshots/\n\n"One of the more common testing practices that marketers experiment with is A/B testing, which lets you test two scenarios at once to determine which your audience responds to better. This is done by having control and variable scenarios, which are randomly displayed to users when they visit your site.\n\nThese changes can be as small as testing the color of a CTA button to seeing whether adding a video on a landing page will increase registrations. For example, one user may see a green “Sign Up Now” button, while the other sees a red one. During an A/B test, you may look to see which one gets more clicks in order to inform which color you want to set the button to."\n\nA/B testing tools from a list complied in:\nhttps://www.ventureharbour.com/best-a-b-testing-tools/\n\nGoogle Analytics & Google Optimize - Free\nOptimizely\nVWO\nZoho PageSense\nHubSpot\nLeadformly\nUnbounce\nConvertize\nKameleoon\nConvert\n',

            answer:
              'A very complete answer from:\nhttps://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-create-a-multicolor-text-in-html-and-css.html\n\nYou can create a multicolor text with the help of image editors such as Pixelmator, Photoshop and so on. So, you can create a multicolor image and embed it into your website.\nThe multicolor text will not be searchable with this method.\n\nAs a result, your code will look like the following:\n\n<img src="multicolortext.png"/>\n\nMake separate elements¶\n\nAnother way is creating a text with separate elements by using the HTML <span> tag, which is an empty container. This means that you create a multicolor text by putting each letter in a separate element to define a different color for each letter of your text.\nExample of creating a multicolor text with separate elements in HTML:¶\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Title of the document</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <span style="color:#FF0000">H</span>\n    <span style="color:#66CC66">e</span>\n    <span style="color:#FF9966">l</span>\n    <span style="color:#FFCCCC">l</span>\n    <span style="color:#FF0066">o</span>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\nTry it Yourself »\nResult¶\nUse CSS¶\n\nAnd finally, you can use CSS. This is the easiest way of creating such kind of text.\n\nPut your text in a <span> tag and give it a class name "multicolortext". Then, you need the CSS background-image property to add a gradient background to your text with its "linear-gradient" value, where you put the names of your preferred colors.\n\nTo get multicolor text instead of the multicolor background, you need to use the background-clip property, which lets you control how far a background image or color extends beyond the element\'s padding or content. This step gives some colors to your text, but not exactly what you want.\n\nYou can get the final result by making your text color transparent with the color property so that the background color will be reflected in the text.\nExample of creating a multicolor text with HTML and CSS:¶\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>The title of the document</title>\n    <style>\n      .multicolortext {\n        background-image: linear-gradient(to left, violet, indigo, green, blue, yellow, orange, red);\n        -webkit-background-clip: text;\n        -moz-background-clip: text;\n        background-clip: text;\n        color: transparent;\n      }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>\n      <span class="multicolortext">Let’s be creative!</span>\n    </h1>\n  </body>\n</html>',

              'The "head" tag is a vital part of an HTML document, even though it does not get rendered to the DOM. The main purposes are to store external dependencies, like style sheets, JavaScript sheets and more, plus hold meta information like the page title & responsive information.\n\nHere is a basic sample head area:\n\n<head>\n\n<title>Name My Tab</title>\n\n    <meta name="author" content="Obi-Wan Kenobi">\n\n    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">\n\n    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./rule-property-value.css">\n\n    <script src="./anonymous-functions.js"></script>\n\n</head>\n\n\n',

              "This will always be asked, and it is a great opportunity for us to highlight our strengths and interests while getting insight into the company. \n\nThese questions can be anything and we definitely should ask about areas of concern or curiosity. In addition, below are some ideas to include.\n\nWhat code quality standards does the team follow? - This highlights that we care about code quality while giving us an idea of the company's focus.\n\n\tFollowing up this question based on their reply, we can ask:\n\t\t- What is the version control branching strategy..or do they use branches?\n\t\t- What kind of testing do they use? Unit tests? End-to-end tests?\n\t\t- Do they use any sort of feature-toggling?\n\t\t- Do they use continuous integration, continuous delivery or continuous deployment?\n\t\t\t(detail on those: https://tinyurl.com/ybty6fw3)\n\t\t- What is the QA process like?\n\nWhat project or team would I start on? - This shows we care about what we will be doing and who we will be doing it with. We can also see if the project interests us and, most importantly, if we are able to meet the team we are able to see if they seem happy. Even if only a a few names or the team lead's name is given, we might be able to do some research and find out about the people that might be our colleagues. \n\nWhy are you interested in hiring me? \n\n\t\t\t- OR -\n\nWhat are a few reasons you would hire me?\n\n\t- However it is asked, this is a good last question. The purpose is to get them thinking of why they would want to hire us. It also puts them on the spot to think about and say a few nice things about us. After the interview there will be a point when the decision makers will consider what they liked and what didn't grab them, but they will have already begun thinking about the good stuff before we even leave the room.\n\n\nThis last one is a statement instead of a question. We just got them thinking about why they would want to hire us, now we want to detail for them how we are perfect for this role.\n\n\tA few ideas for this:\n\t\t- Highlight the core technologies they use and our experience with them.\n\t\t- Our side projects and how we have continued learning.\n\t\t- Our passion for making teams work and helping other team members get better through solid communication, being calm and positive, mentoring when needed and keeping focused on solutions and goals instead of disagreements.\n\t\t- Anything that we feel we offer and, especially, what sets us apart. This is our final chance to sell ourselves. We need to make it count.",

This is an opportunity to drive home areas where the companies and our interests mesh nicely. In addition, knowing how we want to be better just one year from now can show a commitment to constant growth.\n- Give a brief outline of what your ideal professional self would be five years from now. Make it real and doable, but still a bit of a long reach. Unrealistic goals or extremely small goals are not going to help us look any better. High, but achievable, goals can be inspiring.\n- The five-year goals can include:\n\t\t- A higher understanding of certain principles.\n\t\t- More experience and deeper knowledge in one or two technologies (ideally ones that are associated with the job being considered).\n\t\t- A general increased role and professional status, like becoming a senior dev, leading a team or even entering into management.\n\t\t- One or two new languages, tools or processes that would build on the current ones (ideally meshing with what the company offers, if possible).\n\t\t- Certain experience within a team or some similar goal that relates to being even better working with others.\n\t\t- Conferences, talks, meetups, projects related to career path, etc.\n- Give a brief outline of what your ideal personal self would be five years from now. This can be anything at all and should definitely be genuine. Family life, personal project (writing a book, starting a group, etc), growing hobbies or adding new ones, physical fitness, etc.",

              "It is not necessary to know them all, but more to show a depth of understanding and familiarity with using a few. Adding to this with third-party API's experience, like the Braintree API, or Slack API, can help showcase real-world experience.\n\n\n\nA few options are:\n\t- Geolocations\n\n\t\t        if (navigator.geolocation) {\n\t\t            navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((pos) => {\n\t\t                console.log('Got Location', pos);\n\t\t            }, () => {\n\t\t                console.log('nope')\n\t\t            });\n\t\t        }\n\n\n\n- Media API: This API works for both audio and video. There are a number of methods including play() and pause() as well as load().\n\n- Text Track API: Picking up where the Media API leaves off, the Text Track API allows us to interact with text tracks (subtitles or captions) for the audio and videos.\n\n- Drag and Drop: There are a number of possibilities with this API. Among these, you can add  'draggable' attribute to allow a user to move an element then have event handlers in place on a drop zone so the browser knows where the element can be dropped.\n\n- History API: This spec gives developers more control of the user's browser session. Along with moving the the user forward or backward, we can check the length of the history and even add or remove entries. We can hold data enabling us to restore a page or just update the URL without refreshing the page.\n",

              'Accessibility has become a very big focus for many companies. Knowing they are hiring people that can support this effort is important. The goal for an answer to any question about accessibility is to show that we have a basic understanding combined with being able to about real-world use.\n\nAccessibility is no longer just something nice to incorporate, it is essential for making sure people, best practices and, in some cases, laws are being respected. \n\nA few accessibility features we can incorporate:\n\nThoughtful contrasting colors for people who have trouble seeing color. This allows them to see a difference between two colored areas.\n\nAria labels are important for signalling correct detail to screen readers.\n\nUsing tags instead of CSS properties, like <em> instead of font-weight, will signal to screen-readers the intent to emphasis. This can then be past along to the user.\nThere are tools available, like Lighthouse now included in Chrome Dev Tools, that can run scans and alert us to accessibility concerns.\n\n\nHere is an example of the <em> and an aria label:\n\n\n    <p>Hi my name is Sheev Palpatine, but you can call me <em>EMPORER DARTH SIDIOUS</em></p>\n\n    <button aria-label="Close Modal">Close</button>',

HTTP2 adds a number of features to manage the streams, but leaves old semantics untouched.\n\n\nHTTP/2 supports queries multiplexing, headers compression, priority and more intelligent packet streaming management.

It is important to separate concerns for multi-faceted projects like web pages.\n\n\t<h1 style="color: blue;">Example</h1>\n\n- <style> tags in the documents <head> can be used to assign selectors to declarations. The browser will then link classes used on the elements in the <body> to the selectors in the <style> tag.

We just need to give a brief reasoning that includes our thoughts surrounding big moves, our steps to work with our current employer before making th e moves and how those decisions ended up being good or, perhaps, lessons that we learned from those that did not.\n\nUltimately, we don't want to lie or give the impression we are trying to cover anything up.

            answer:
              "This question is designed to see our thought process on this issue.\n\nHere are some basic steps for approaching a slow app:\n\n\t1. Define the specific problem. What, specifically is slow? Is the initial load slow? Are page transitions slow? Do the interactions, like menu animations, seem slow or choppy? Does this occur on only some browsers or devices? \n\n\t\tUltimately, the goal here is to get as clear a picture as possible as of each part that is slow. This enables us to find the best spots to begin drilling down.\n\n\t2. Narrow the scope: Next we want to take our drill-down points and begin to narrow each of those to as small a piece of code as we can. \n\n\t\tFor instance, if the issue is slow loading, a good place to start is either Chrome Dev Tools' Lighthouse tool or a page speed analyzer. One popular one is: \n\n\t\thttps://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/\n\n\t\tThese tools can help see where it is slow, like the first paint or how long until a user can actually interact with the page. From there it can help us pinpoint potential problem areas, like large images or slow server response.\n\n\t\tin a browser's dev tools we can use other tools, like the Network section to see detail on specific items like when they loaded, how long they took and if they were blocking progress. \n\n\t\tIf the issue is something not related to resources loading, dev tools can help narrow down the search using the Debugger, Performance, Inspector, Console and others. \n\n\t3. Isolate: Once we gained an understanding of the specific symptoms and then narrowed the scope of our attention, we can now address these specific areas of code. Dev tools Debugger can be great for stepping through JavaScript. The Performance tool can help see how an animation affects the page processing. \n\n\t\tIf need be, it can help to isolate specific blocks of code in a separate editor, perhaps even an online editor like repl.it, codepen.io or jsbin.com. This can help zero-in on specific problems in the code.\n\t\tAlong the same line of thinking, commenting out blocks of code and/or temporarily inserting new simplified code can help ensure we have properly identified the problem area.\n\n\t4. Fix: By this point, we have arrived at the problem pieces of code. Now, we just need to correct the issue.\n\n\t5. Test...a lot: We have not fixed the problem at this point. We have only written the code that we think will correct the issue. Test. Test. Test then take a break...test again. At that point, we have fixed teh issue.",

              'There are a wide array of strategies for this answer. Below are a few basic approaches, though a web search (click the "More About this Question" button for that) will yield a wealth of detail and other options.\n\n- We can just give an amount we would like to make and we think we are worth. it is simple and direct, though it might be a factor in eliminating us from the candidate list if the number far exceeds what the company wants to spend on the position or thinks we are worth. This approach is not concerned with staying in market value. It is more about weeding out companies that can not or do not wish to pay what we value our services at. \n\n- We can take our current salary and just raise that a little. Assuming we are applying for a similar position, or even slightly elevated, this keeps us around market range. \n\n- If the job is meant to be an entry into a new career, pushing for more money might hurt the greater purpose. We might want to consider looking for the salary range listed in the job post and speaking to an amount towards the middle, with a minimum around the listed minimum. Or, perhaps, if our situation is one where little more or less would not matter and getting in the door is the focus, being honest about this can be OK. It would be best to also ask how soon someone is eligible for a raise and to make sure they do not offer below their posted minimum. There are some who would say never ask for or imply the offered minimum, but getting the first foot in can make a tremendous difference and then enable us to make the next interview about what we are really worth.\n\n- Use online tools to find a market salary range and then ask for a salary somewhere between the average and the top salary depending on where our skills and experience put us.\n\n\n\tA few tools for finding market value:\n\n\t\tGlassDoor: https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/index.htm\n\t\tPayScale: https://www.payscale.com/my/survey/choose\n\t\tLinkedin Salary Tool: https://www.linkedin.com/salary/',

            answer:
              'This answer comes from:\nhttps://resource-centre.net/html5-tutorials/bullet-point-lists/\n\nBullet Point Lists (or Unordered Lists)\n\nThe first kind of list we will look at is using bullets.\nUnordered List – the <ul> Tag\n\nBullet point lists are also known as unordered lists (UL) because there is no numbering involved. That is why a bulleted list uses the <ul> </ul> tag pair. Here is a basic example:\n\nThe whole list is surrounded by <ul> </ul> for a start. When you open your list tag, make sure you automatically type your closing tag and then proceed to fill your items between them.\nThe type Attribute\n\nThe type attribute determines what kind of bullet you are seeing on the page. Although through CSS you can specify a wide-range of bullet styles, and even use your own image, in raw HTML it is best to stick with the common types which are\n\n    type="circle" – an unfilled circle\n\n    type="disc" – a filled circle\n\n    type="square" – a filled square\n\nList Items – the <li> Tag\n\nEach individual item in your list is wrapped in its own <li> </li> tag pair. You can often get away without the </li> but I would recommend keeping it in, just so you maintain healthy coding habit.\n\nThe list above I placed in individual <ul> but each <li> also supports the type attribute, such that I could create\n\n    Square\n    Disc\n    Circle\n\nNot sure why you would want to do that, but you can if you want to!\n\nBullet List Indentation\n\nBefore you apply any CSS to your list, HTML (or more accurately, your browser) will apply indentation to your list, so it stands out from your normal paragraph <p> tags.\nOrdered / Numbered Lists – the <ol> Tag\n\nIf you want to present your list in an ordered fashion, then the <ol> tag is your friend. By default this will give you a numbered list, but the type attribute gives you flexibility, in the same way as bullet point lists do.\n\nwhich outputs\n\n    Item 1\n    Item 2\n    Item 3\n\nThe type attribute offers a few more options in ordered lists compared to bulleted ones. A bit more guidance on this can be obtained at W3Schools.\nStarting an Ordered List On A Different Number\n\nSay you were putting together some instructions to build a table. You may want to use a numbered list to achieve this. However, if you wanted to put images and extra text between each stage, you would probably need multiple lists. The problem is that each list starts at number 1 (or letter A) by default. That would screw up your instructions!\n\nThankfully HTML has the start property to allow you to start on a subsequent number:\n\nThis outputs:\n\n    Step Four\n    Step Five\n    Step Six\n\nReversing The Order\n\nIf you want to show your numbers (or letters) in reverse order, then this is really easy too. You might want to do a ‘Top 10’ with your best item announced last, for example. This can be done by adding the word reversed into your Ordered List opening tag:\n\nAnd this would make your list look like this:\n\n    First LI\n    Second LI\n    Third LI\n    Fourth LI\n    Fifth LI\n\nMulti-Level Bullet List in HTML\n\nWith patchy browser support (and sometimes undone by CSS in some sites) you can create a multilevel list. This is achieved by embedding one list inside another:\n\nWhich creates:\n\n    Top Level Item\n        Sub-Item 1\n        Sub-Item 2\n    Top Level Item\n\nYou can use a combination of <ul> and <ol>. That may be useful if you want bullet points under a numbered list.\n\n    Top Level Item\n        Sub-Item 1\n        Sub-Item 2\n    Top Level Item\n',

Overall, we want to exhibit good communication skills, and a brief bit about how important we think communication skills are when working with teams, or our superiors, the client, etc can help. Perhaps even a story about a time when kept our calm when others did not, or an example of how we set aside things that bothered us, and were able to generate harmony that helped move a project forward. All of this needs to be delivered, like all of our answers, with good eye contact without staring, enthusiasm married with a calm and thoughtful approach and general good will and respectful manner. These qualities can mean a lot to a company and can raise our profile above others in the eyes of the interviewer.\n",

              'The following excerpt come from bitofco.de:\nhttps://bitsofco.de/understanding-the-virtual-dom/\n\nWhy do we need a virtual DOM?\n\nTo understand why the concept of the virtual DOM arose, let’s revisit the original DOM. As I mentioned, there are two parts to the DOM - the object-based representation of the HTML document and the API to manipulating that object.\n\nFor example, let’s take this simple HTML document with an unordered list and one list item.\n\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang="en">\n <head></head>\n <body>\n    <ul class="list">\n        <li class="list__item">List item</li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\n\nThis document can be represented as the following DOM tree:\n\nhtml\nhead lang="en"\nbody\nul class="list"\nli class="list__item"\n"List item"\n\nLet’s say we want to modify the content of the first list item to \n"List item one"\n and also add a second list item. To do this, we will need use the DOM APIs to find the elements we want to update, create the new elements, add attributes and content, then finally update the DOM elements themselves.\n\nconst listItemOne = document.getElementsByClassName("list__item")[0];\nlistItemOne.textContent = "List item one";\n\nconst list = document.getElementsByClassName("list")[0];\nconst listItemTwo = document.createElement("li");\nlistItemTwo.classList.add("list__item");\nlistItemTwo.textContent = "List item two";\nlist.appendChild(listItemTwo);\n\nThe DOM wasn’t made for this…\n\nWhen the first specification for the DOM was released in 1998, we built and managed web pages in very differently. There was far less reliance on the DOM APIs to create and update the page content as frequently as we do today.\n\nSimple methods such as \ndocument.getElementsByClassName()\n are fine to use on a small scale, but if we are updating multiple elements on a page every few seconds, it can start to become really expensive to constantly query and update the DOM.\n\nEven further, because of the way the APIs are setup, it is usually simpler to perform more expensive operations where we update larger parts of the document than to find and update the specific elements. Going back to our list example, it is in some ways easier to replace the entire unordered list with a new one than to modify the specific elements.\n\nconst list = document.getElementsByClassName("list")[0];\nlist.innerHTML = `\n<li class="list__item">List item one</li>\n<li class="list__item">List item two</li>\n`;\n\n\nIn this particular example, the performance difference between the methods is probably insignificant. However, as the size of the web page grows, it becomes more important to only select and update what is needed.\n\n… but the virtual DOM was!\n\nThe virtual DOM was created to solve these problems of needing to frequently update the DOM in a more performant way. Unlike the DOM or the shadow DOM, the virtual DOM isn\'t an official specification, but rather a new method of interfacing with the DOM.\n\nA virtual DOM can be thought of as a copy of the original DOM. This copy can be frequently manipulated and updated, without using the DOM APIs. Once all the updates have been made to the virtual DOM, we can look at what specific changes need to be made to the original DOM and make them in a targetted and optimised way.',

            answer:
              'Meta tags are used in an HTML document to provide detail about the specific document. This could be to provide context, like to credit the page author, or detail for search engine optimization (SEO), or any info that can be helpful to pass along, but does not belong in the content of the rendered page. This information can be minor detail or even to instruct the browser to treat the document differently, like on the "viewport" settings to make a page responsive or "refresh" to have the page refresh at a certain interval.\n\nHere are a few  meta info samples:\n\n    <meta chartset="UTF-8">\n\n    <meta description="Meta Tag Example">\n\n    <meta keywords="html, head, meta, tags">\n\n    <meta author="Ben Solo">\n\n    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">\n\n    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">',

            answer:
              "Questions about components can usually be answered either generally or specific to a framework, if we choose. We just need to demonstrate an understanding of the core concepts.\n\nThere have been the addition of web components native to the browser. modern frameworks have already had components built in for a while.\n\nA component will usually have an HTML template that we can pass in properties or other data. This allows us to build a component once and then use it multiple times. \n\nCommon uses are a navigation menu or model or buttons. These components can really be anything that we might want to use multiple times.\n\nEach component is encapsulated to ensure internal code will not collide with any document they are used in.\n\n\n\nWeb Component example from MDN (frameworks' syntax can be different):\n\nThis would be in a word-count.js file:\n\n// Create a class for the element\nclass WordCount extends HTMLParagraphElement {\n  constructor() {\n    // Always call super first in constructor\n    super();\n\n    // count words in element's parent element\n    const wcParent = this.parentNode;\n\n    function countWords(node){\n      const text = node.innerText || node.textContent;\n      return text.split(/\\s+/g).length;\n    }\n\n    const count = `Words: ${countWords(wcParent)}`;\n\n    // Create a shadow root\n    const shadow = this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});\n\n    // Create text node and add word count to it\n    const text = document.createElement('span');\n    text.textContent = count;\n\n    // Append it to the shadow root\n    shadow.appendChild(text);\n\n    // Update count when element content changes\n    setInterval(function() {\n      const count = `Words: ${countWords(wcParent)}`;\n      text.textContent = count;\n    }, 200);\n  }\n}\n\n// Define the new element\ncustomElements.define('word-count', WordCount, { extends: 'p' });\n\n\n\nHere is how to use it in a document:\n<script src=\"word-count.js\"></script>\n<p is=\"word-count\"></p>",

In the common case of HTML, the rendering engine parses HTML and CSS, and displays the parsed content on the screen.\n\n    Networking: network calls such as HTTP requests, using different implementations for different platform behind a platform-independent interface.\n\n    UI backend: This exposes a generic interface that is not platform specific. Underneath it uses operating system user interface methods all for drawing basic items like combo boxes and windows. \n\n    JavaScript interpreter: Used to parse and execute JavaScript code.\n\n    Data storage: The browser may need to save all sorts of data locally, such as cookies. Browsers also support storage mechanisms such as localStorage, IndexedDB, WebSQL and FileSystem.\n\nThe flow:\n\n           | <--------  USER INTERFACE\t\t\t\t________\nUI BACKEND |\t                 V\t\t\t\t\t     DATA\n           |            BROWSER ENGINE --------->  STORAGE\n           |                  V\t\t\t\t       ---------\n           | <------   RENDERING ENGINE\n                         V\t        V\t        \t\n                  NETWORKING   JAVASCRIPT INTERPRETER    \n",

              "This very basic question should prompt an easy and basic answer.  We just need to show we understand the general process.\n\n- We initiate a request using the domain name system with the URL as an address. \n- The server that houses the address will be located via the internet and the request is made.\n- The server then serves up the requested data.\n- The data is transferred via the web back to the browser.\n- \t\n\n\n- The web browser that you are using will contact a DNS (Domain Name System) server.\n- The DNS will translate the website name into a numeric IP address (every website domain name is basically an alias for an IP address). \n- The IP address is sent to the browser.\n- The browser uses this IP address to locate the server hosting the web page and, using the TCP protocol, opens a connection via port 80 on the server. In some cases, authentication can be part of this connection. This might be a JSON web token, or some other data, included in the request.\n- The server will then send the requested data to the browser.\n- The browser will then render the page to the screen. \n\n- The new web page might include dependencies, like CSS ot JavaScript sheets, or images, etc. The browser will then either request these via the same connection, or, if the begin the process for a new connection to retrieve each item.\n\n- Once the browser page (tab or window) is closed, the connection to the server ends.\n\n",

              "Links can be created using the <a> tag, with referencing through the use of the number (#) symbol. For example, you can have one line as <a href=”#topmost”>BACK TO TOP</a>, which would result in the words “BACK TO TOP” appearing on the webpage and links to a bookmark named topmost. You then create a separate tag command like <a name=”topmost”> somewhere on the top of the same webpage so that the user will be linked to that spot when he clicked on “BACK TO TOP”.",

              "This type of question is designed to see both our view on dealing with workplace conflict, but also how you approach the question. Our goal is to show that we not only have dealt with conflict but that we have thought about it and worked through the difficult aspects. The worst thing we can do is not have an answer, or say we have never encountered any conflict. That is not realistic and it leaves the question wide open as to what they can expect from us if we encounter conflict while working there. Even a story about how we handled conflict poorly is fine, as long as we can talk clearly about how we thought and felt at the time and how we eventually learned how to handle it all better. \n\nTo put it simply:\n\tBe human. \n\tShow growth. \n\tShow thought. \n\tShow intent to understand others, even if they are acting poorly. \n\tShow a desire to explore the finer points of human interaction.\n\tShow that all of the above maters enough to have carefully thought about it.\n",

Led by Web inventor and Director Tim Berners-Lee and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe, W3C\'s mission is to lead the Web to its full potential.\n\n\nWhat does W3C do?\n\nW3C\'s primary activity is to develop protocols and guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the Web. W3C\'s standards define key parts of what makes the World Wide Web work. Learn more about W3C\'s mission.\nWhere is W3C located?\n\nW3C does not have a single physical headquarters. There are four institutions, however, that "host" W3C: MIT (in Cambridge, MA, USA), ERCIM (in Sophia-Antipolis, France), Keio University (near Tokyo, Japan), and Beihang University (in Beijing, China).\n\nThe W3C staff is distributed around the world, but there are concentrations of people in Cambridge, Massachusetts (USA), Sophia-Antipolis (France), and Tokyo (Japan). In addition, W3C is represented in 17 other regions of the world via representatives based at organizations. W3C calls these regional points of contact "W3C Offices."\nHow is W3C funded?\n\nW3C receives funds from:\n\n    W3C Member dues\n    Research grants and other sources of private and public funding\n    Individual donations of money and equipment \n\nWhat is the difference between the Web and the Internet?\n\nFrom the definition in the Wikipedia: "The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that interchange data by packet switching using the standardized Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)."\n\nThus, the Internet is a network of networks, defined by the TPC/IP standards.\n\nThe Web, on the other hand, is defined in W3C\'s Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume I as follows: "The World Wide Web (WWW, or simply Web) is an information space in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI)."\n\nThus, the Web is an information space.

              "What is async, defer, preload and prefetch for loading JavaScript documents",
            answer:
              'All of this addresses the loading of documents and how they affect the main document.\n\nFrom:https://javascript.info/script-async-defer\n\n\nDEFER:\n\nThe defer attribute tells the browser not to wait for \nthe script. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, \nbuild DOM. The script loads “in the background”, and then runs when the \nDOM is fully built.\n\nHere’s the same example with defer:\n<p>...content before script...</p>\n\n<scrip/t defer src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js?speed=1"></scrip/t>\n\n<!-- visible immediately -->\n<p>...content after script...</p>\n\n\nIn other words:\n\n    - Scripts with defer never block the page.\n    - Scripts with defer always execute when the DOM is ready (but before DOMContentLoaded event).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASYNC\n\nThe async attribute is somewhat like \ndefer. It also makes the script non-blocking. But it has important differences in the behavior.\n\nThe async attribute means that a script is completely independent:\n\n    - The browser doesn’t block on async scripts (like defer).\n    - Other scripts don’t wait for async scripts, and async scripts don’t wait for them.\n    - DOMContentLoaded and async scripts don’t wait for each other:\n        | DOMContentLoaded may happen both before an async script (if an async script finishes loading after the page is complete)\n        | …or after an async script (if an async script is short or was in HTTP-cache)\n\n    <p>...content before scripts...</p>\n\n    <scrip/t>\n      document.addEventListener(\'DOMContentLoaded\', () => alert("DOM ready!"));\n    </scrip/t>\n\n    <scrip/t async src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js"></scrip/t>\n    <scrip/t async src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/small.js"></scrip/t>\n\n    <p>...content after scripts...</p>\n\n\n\nThe following examples come from: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/html-preload-prefetch\n\n\n    \nPRELOAD\n\nPreloading JavaScript resources is done differently. This example, taken from this Google Developers article on preloading, shows this:\nindex.html\n\n<link rel="preload" href="used-later.js" as="scrip/t">\n<!-- ... -->\n<scrip/t>\n  var usedLaterScript = document.createElement(\'script\');\n  usedLaterScript.src = \'used-later.js\';\n  document.body.appendChild(usedLaterScript);\n</scrip/t>\n\n\n\nPREFETCH\n\nPrefetching works similarly to preloading. The difference is that, \nwhen prefetching a resource, the browser considers the resource to be \nlow priority. This means that the resource or asset will load a bit \nlater. Because of this, prefetching is usually implemented with \nresources that are not required initially, but are used at a later \npoint.\n\nTo implement prefectching in your HTML page, change the value of \nrel to "prefetching.\n\nindex.html\n<link\n  rel="prefetch"\n  as="style"\n  onload="this.rel = \'stylesheet\'"\n  href=\'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:100,900|Material+Icons\'>\n',

              'This is generally asked to get an idea of how much someone pays attention to good practices and, ultimately, will write easier to understand code and have an easier time jumping into someone else\'s code.\n\nGeneral naming conventions:\n-\tNames should be brief, but descriptive enough that the average non-developer could understand. For example, using "d = new Date()" might serve brevity, but can make no sense later in the program and require extra effort to understand. Conversely, "theDateForTheDayTheAppIsRun = new Date()" is clear, but unnecessarily long. Simply "todaysDate = new Date()" is brief and easily understood.\n\nA few JavaScript examples can be:\n- Camel case for variables: const lastName = \'Kenobi\'\n- Pascal case for classes: class MainCharacter { }\n- "is" or "has" prefix for booleans.\n- Function calls that will be returning something can start with have a descriptive verb ("update", "get", etc).\n- As few variables as possible. This is not really a naming convention, but it greatly affects the abilty for the names of the variables that do get used to be easier to follow and keep track of.\n- Do not re-use variable names.\n- In many cases it is better not to make a variable equal itself with modification. This can be difficult to follow through and can often be better served with a new, variable descriptively named to match the newly formed data.\n- When reasonable, if a specific item in an array is being used, assign a more descriptive variable: const updatedFileId = changes[0]\n- Property names that do not need to be prefixed with the class name. \n\tWe do not need: class Car {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructor(brand, purchaseDate) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.carName = brand;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.carYear = purchaseDate;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n} \n\tInstead, we can use: class Car {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructor(brand) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.name = brand;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.year = purchaseDate;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t} \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t// in use it will still be descriptive\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconst myCar = new Car();\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmyCar,name = \'Jeep\';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmyCar.year = \'2017\';\n- Avoid "magic" numbers, or numbers without a name, when possible. \n\tWe want to avoid: const forwardMovement = duration * 3;\n\tWe can use: const rate = 3;\n\t\t\t\t  forwardMovement = duration * rate;\n\t\t\t\t \n\nCSS & HTML examples:\n- Use nicely cascading rules to make for as few selectors as possible.\n- Kabab case for selectors: .inner-wrap\n- Descriptive selector names. This can be the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) method or similar.\n- Try to avoid using the same name for an ID and a class. These are technically independent from each other, but this can cause confusion for a developer.\n',

In an object literal, the spread syntax enumerates the properties of an object and adds the key-value pairs to the object being created.\n\nSpread syntax looks exactly like rest syntax. In a way, spread syntax is the opposite of rest syntax. Spread syntax "expands" an array into its elements, while rest syntax collects multiple elements and "condenses" them into a single element. See rest parameters and rest property.\n\nfunction sum(x, y, z) {\n\n  return x + y + z;\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3];\n\n\n\n\nconsole.log(sum(...numbers));\n\n// Expected output: 6\n\n\n\n\nconsole.log(sum.apply(null, numbers));\n\n// Expected output: 6\n\n\n',

            answer:
              'This might sound like a silly question, but questions like this sometimes are used to get us to show our understanding of basic, but often needed, aspects of CSS. This will usually be a screening question, so a descriptive verbal outline will needed, not actual code.\n\nTo begin, we need to target our element via ID, or by class for multiple elements. We then want to set an equal width and height, perhaps 100px each. From there, we can either set the border for a few pixels or a background color or even both. This way we can see it. At that point, we have a square.\n\nMaking that square a circle simply requires a border-radius of 50% all of the way around. \n\nNow, that is a fixed width square or circle. We could make it responsive by using a percentage as the width and an equal percentage as padding-bottom. If there is content in the square or circle, one way to keep the sides equal would be to absolutely position the content. Ultimately, this is just an option. There are many ways to approach graphics in CSS, and purpose and the rest of the document will play into a plan for making the graphics responsive.\n\n\nPaste this example into an online editor, like https://codepen.io/pen/, to see the square and circle:\n\n\tCSS\n\t\t.square {\n\t\t\tbackground: lightgreen;\n\t\t\twidth: 50%;\n\t\t\tpadding-bottom: 50%;\n\t\t\tmargin: 0 auto;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t.square.circle {\n\t\t\tborder-radius: 50%;\n\t\t\tbackground: salmon;\n\t\t}\n\n\tHTML\n\t\t<div class="square"></div>\n\n\t\t<div class="square circle"></div>',

            answer:
              "The days of great consideration being paid to Internet Explorer's many differences will, or possibly have, come to an end. This does not mean browser compatibility is no longer a concern. \nModern browsers are much more consistent with including features, but it is still good to check with a tool like https://caniuse.com/ or MDN to make sure new features are well covered.\n\nFor most browsers, we can easily download them and test our app. But what about older versions of each browser? What about these browsers on different devices. What if we need to test on Safari, but do not have access to a Mac? There are tools like https://www.browserstack.com/ to test web apps in many different ways. Some will even monitor real users on different browsers and devices. We can even have automated routines to test these scenarios.  \n\nBeyond testing, it is important that we know well what our target audience is going to be. If it is truly a global reach we are seeking, we need to consider things like Opera Mini (popular in parts of the world with slow internet), Baidu (a popular China-based browser), KaiOS' browser (mobile OS and browser used all over and especially in India) and any others that are used.\n\nAll of this does not mean that wide-reach intentions mean we need to remove most of our JavaScript just to make the app work right on Opera Mini. It just means just that we need to consider what happens to our product for the those users and work towards good solutions. \n\nWhithin any app, we should pay attention to current browser compatibility and utilize thinking along these lines:\n\n\t- We might just need to ensure there are fullbacks in place.\n\n\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\tposition: sticky; // Not fully supported by some browsers\n\n\t- We can plan our interactions and layouts so that nothing critical relies on technology not fully supported.\t\n\n\t- We can check for specific feature support in a browser and have separate functionality ready. This is not ideal as it requires extra consideration when maintaining the web app, but it is a workable solution.\n\n\t- We and the customer can consider the costs vs the gains related to supporting certain browsers. The benefits might not offset the costs of supporting a specific browser's use and/or the areas of the world it is popular.",

              'Some browsers accept additional proprietary non-standard non-css syntax on top of the usual css. Less is build on top of standard css and therefore may not recognize it. You may also need to put an otherwise non-parseable value inside a variable and use it to dynamically build selector or other css part during compilation time.\n\nEscaping allows you to use any arbitrary string as property or variable value. It can be used also to dynamically build selectors, but that feature is deprecated and replaced by different more powerful option.\n\nSyntax\n\nUse either ~"whatever" or ~\'whatever\' syntax to escape property values. Anything between quotes is used as is with almost no changes. The "as is" rule has one exception: string interpolation works with the usual @{variableName} syntax.\n\nUsed as Property Value\n\nSample input:\n\n@variable: "dynamic";\nh1 {\n  margin: 1 ~"2 2" 3;\n  padding: ~\'ms:special.syntax()\';\n  text: ~\'@{variable}\'; //interpolation works\n}\n\ncompiles into:\n\nh1 {\n  margin: 1 2 2 3;\n  padding: ms:special.syntax();\n  text: dynamic;\n}\n\n',

              "Excerpts from hacker.io:\n\nCSS was originally released in 1996 and consists of properties for adding font properties such as typeface and emphasis color of text, backgrounds, and other elements. CSS2 was released in 1998 with added styles for other media types so that it can be used for page layout designing. CSS3 was released in 1999 and presentation-style properties were added in it that allows you to build a presentation from documents.\n\nUnlike CSS2, which was comprised of a single document, CSS3 has its specifications divided into many individual modules, which makes CSS3 a whole lot easier to handle.\n\nWith CSS3, the designers can now use special fonts, like those available in Google Fonts and Typecast. Earlier, with CSS and CSS2, designers could only use “web-safe fonts” for being 100% sure to use fonts that would always display the same on every machine.\n\nWhile CSS and CSS2 had ‘simple selectors’, CSS3 calls the components as ‘a sequence of simple selectors’.\n\nCSS3 came up with some key web design considerations like rounded borders that help in rounding up the borders without any hassle. This turned out to be a huge plus point for developers who were struggling with initial versions of CSS borders.\n\nCSS3 has the capability to split text sections into multiple columns so that it can be read like a newspaper. In CSS2, the developers had difficulty because the standard was not equipped with automatically breaking the text so that it fits within a box.\n\n",

              'Synchronous code runs from top to bottom in order. One line, command, function, etc is processed and resolved before moving to the next. This can be problematic if you encounter "blocking" code, which is code that causes processing one item for a longer amount of time. This means the rest of the program (and end user) wait until the program can mover on to the next line. This is where asynchronous code can be helpful.\n\nAsynchronous code runs separately from other code. This means it can take longer to process without "blocking" the rest of the program from running. In JavaScript, the Call Stack processes code synchronously. If a piece of asynchronous code is encountered, it is moved out of the Call Stack. If it is part of a Web API, like setTimeOut(), then the browser handles the resolving the code. Otherwise, it is moved to the Callback Que. In either case, the Event Loop will take the next item that has resolved, and place it on the Call Stack. This time, when the code can be dealt with in order because it is ready and will not block the processing the rest of the program.',

A positive shape automatically creates a negative shape.    \n\n\nDIRECTION – All lines have direction – Horizontal, Vertical or Oblique. Horizontal suggests calmness, stability and tranquility. Vertical gives a feeling of balance, formality and alertness. Oblique suggests movement and action    \n\n\nSIZE – Size is simply the relationship of the area occupied by one shape to that of another.    \n\n\nTEXTURE – Texture is the surface quality of a shape – rough, smooth, soft hard glossy etc.    \n\n\nCOLOR – Color is light reflected off objects. Color has three main characteristics: hue or its name (red, green, blue, etc.), value (how light or dark it is), and intensity (how bright or dull it is).",

            answer:
              "Closure is an inner function, that is accessible outside of its parent function's scope while maintaining its connection to the parent's variables and other data. This can be don to keep some data private and purposely expose other data.\nTo accomplish this, an anonymous function can be immediately invoked. In this function, data we wish to keep  private can be processed. Usually this data would be removed from memory via JavaScript's \"garbage collection\" memory clearing process. If this function returns a function, let's call it a child function, that accesses data from the parent function, the parent's data will remain in memory. In this situation, the only access to the parent function's data will be via whatever had been set up in the child function. In addition, every time the child function is invoked, a new function scope is created for the child function. The parent function scope is only created once. This means that we can invoke the child function to change a variable in the parent and the next time we invoke the child function the variable in the parent will still reflect the change. \n\nThis can be considered state management and might not be as useful today given other options to manage state. Still, this process can be used to protect sensitive data or even just a to keep a counter variable from being accidentally increased.\n\nSome examples\n// For comparison, this is a counter without closure\nlet counter = 0;\n\nfunction add1 () {\n\tcounter++;\n\treturn counter;\n}\n\nconsole.log(add1());  // 1\nconsole.log(add1());  // 2\n// The counter becomes unpredictable when it can be altered elswhere\ncounter++;\nconsole.log(add1());  // 4\n\n\n// This is a counter with closure\nconst add1 = (function () {\n  let counter = 0;\n\n  return function () {\n\tcounter++;\n\treturn counter;\n  };\n})();\nconsole.log(add1());  // 1\nconsole.log(add1());  // 2\nconsole.log(add1());  // 3\ncounter++;// error: counter is not defined\nconsole.log(add1());\n\n// Another, more complex example\n// In this travelAgent() in the child function made available, while \n// the \"trip\" variable and agent() function are accessible through \n// travelAgent(). The book() function, is only accessible through agent().\nfunction vacation() {\n\tvar trip;\n\n\tfunction travelAgent(itinerary) {\n\t\tagent(itinerary);\n\t\treturn trip;\n\t}\n\n\tfunction agent(itinerary) {\n\t\tif (itinerary === 'Orlando') {\n\t\t\ttrip = ['Orlando', 'Disney', 'Universal'];\n\t\t\tbook();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tfunction book() {\n\t\ttrip.push('booked');\n\t}\n\treturn travelAgent;\n}\n\nvar myVacation = vacation();\n\nconsole.log(myVacation('Orlando'));\n\n// Array [ \"Orlando\", \"Disney\", \"Universal\", \"booked\" ]\n",

A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.\n\nO - Open-closed principle. Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.\n\nL - Liskov substitution principle. Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.\n\nI - Interface segregation principle. A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.\n\nD - Dependency Inversion Principle. Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.\n\nHere is a good article on the subject: https://dev.to/francescoxx/solid-principles-in-javascript-3pek\n",

So, it is easy for designers and developers to work more efficiently and quickly.\n    It is compatible with all versions of CSS. So, you can use any available CSS libraries.\n    It provides nesting so you can use nested syntax and useful functions like color manipulation, math functions and other values.\n\nDisadvantages\n\n    The developer must have enough time to learn new features present in this preprocessor before using it.\n    Using Sass may result in the loss of some benefits of a browser's built-in element inspector.",

              "This addresses what happens when passing data from one variable to another. More specifically, this is about where variables point. \n\nThe original variable points to a place in memory. The new variable can either point to the same place in memory, which means the reference to the data was passed, or the new variable can point to a new place in memory that contains the same data, which means the values were passed to the new memory location.\n\nThe main reason this is important is shown by the results of changing either variable. If only a reference was passed, meaning both variables point to the same data at the same memory location, then changing a value will change change it for both variables, as well as any others pointing to the same place in memory.\n\nIf the actual values were passed and reside at a new location in memory, changing the values at the new memory location will only be visible with the new variable (and any others pointing to that location). The original variable is still pointing at the old memory location and remains unchanged.\n\nExamples:\nlet example1 = 1;\nlet example2 = example1;\nexample2++;\n\nconsole.log(example1, ' - ', example2);\n\nconst example3 = {\n  weapon: 'lightsaber'\n};\nconst example4 = {\n  ...example3\n};\nexample4.name = 'Darth Vader';\nconsole.log(example3, ' - ', example4);",

It is positioned relative to the initial containing block established by the viewport, except when one of its ancestors has a transform, perspective, or filter property set to something other than none (see the CSS Transforms Spec), in which case that ancestor behaves as the containing block. (Note that there are browser inconsistencies with perspective and filter contributing to containing block formation.) Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left. \n\nThis value always creates a new stacking context.

Note that a sticky element "sticks" to its nearest ancestor that has a "scrolling mechanism" (created when overflow is hidden, scroll, auto, or overlay), even if that ancestor isn\'t the nearest actually scrolling ancestor.

Luckily, that’s easy!\n\nIf you’re wanting to style occurrences of a certain class inside another class, you can write the following:\n\n.nav .nav-item { ... }\n\nThe above targets any .nav-item inside .nav. If you only want those that are immediately inside the .nav as opposed to any level deep, you can add the > character, like so:\n\n.nav > .nav-item { ... }\n\nWant to target a button only if it’s next to another button? The + character has got you covered:\n\n.button + .button { ... }",

              "Here is a video introduction to hooks:\nhttps://youtu.be/dpw9EHDh2bM\n\n\nHooks let you use state and other React features without writing a class.\n\n\nExample of the useState hook:\n\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Example() {\n  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call \"count\"  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\n        Click me\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nA few snippets from https://softwareontheroad.com/react-hooks/\n\n\n When you work with Reactjs class components you can use state, that’s why these components are also called stateful, also every class component has lifecycle methods like: componentDidMount(), componentDidUpdate(), and so on.\n\nYou can’t use any of this in functional components. Functional components can’t use their own state and don’t have lifecycle methods.\n\nNow with React hooks you can.\n\nReact hooks allows us to take a Reactjs functional component and add state and lifecycle methods to it.\n\nIn simple words, React hooks are special functions to extend the capabilities of functional components and give them the possibility to have lifecycle events and manage state.\n\n\nThe existing React hooks 🍱\n\nThe new API comes with two main pre-existing hooks, and some others for other use cases\nBasics React hooks\n\nThe foundation of all React hooks, every other hook you will see is a variation of these three or are using them as primitives.\n\n    useState is the State hook use it for declaring the state in your components\n    useEffect is the Side effects hook use it for data fetching, manually changing the DOM, and etc.\n    useContext use it in conjunction with Reactjs Context API. When the React Context provider updates, this hook will trigger render with the latest context value.\n\nAdvance React hooks\n\nThese are the most important of the other built-in React hooks that come with the library.\n\n    The useReducer is an alternative to useState, you should use it when you have complex state logic, if you’re familiar with Redux you will like it.\n    The useRef use it for accessing a DOM element with a mutable ref object. Is more useful than the ref attribute\n\n\n\nRules\n\n    Never call Hooks from inside a loop, condition or nested function\n    Never call a Hook from a regular function\n    Only call them inside functions components or custom hooks\n    Hooks should sit at the top level of your component\n    Hooks can call other Hooks\n\n\n\n",

              "Comparing to see if two objects are not really just one referencing the other: Object.is(). This will tell us if one is really just a variable that was passed a reference to the original object, like with: const var1 = obj1; This is only a reference, so Object.is(var1, obj1) will equal true. If so, the values will always be identical.\n\nComparing unique objects can be a little more involved. There is a loose approach and a more strict approach. \n\nWe can test the number of entries in each, as a different number of entries would indicate they are different. We can do this by checking if one has more keys than the other using Object.keys().length or Object.getOwnPropertyNames().length.\nWhen iterating through the objects, we must also account for the possibility of nested arrays and/or objects. These might even go many levels deep.\n\nOne way is to turn both objects into strings using JSON.stringify() and then compare the strings. This will ONLY work if we know the keys will always be IN THE SAME ORDER. When using this method, any variance, like a key being in a different place, will cause the comparison to fail even though the values might be identical.\n\nA more strict approach is to iterate through each object and check the key-value pair against the other. This will work even if the keys are not in the same order. \n\n\nconst user1 = {\n  first: 'Lando',\n  last: 'Calrissian'\n};\nconst user2 = {\n  first: 'Lando',\n  last: 'Calrissian'\n};\n\n\n// Direct comparison\nconsole.log(user1 === user2);  // false\n\n// Stringify process\nconst stringObj1 = JSON.stringify(user1);\nconst stringObj2 = JSON.stringify(user2);\n\nconsole.log(typeof stringObj1);  // string\nconsole.log(stringObj1 === stringObj2);  // true\n\n\n\n// Iterating process possibiltiy\nfunction isSameObject (obj1, obj2) {\n  const props1 = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj1);\n  const props2 = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj2);\n\n  if (props1.length !== props2.length) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < props1.length; i++) {\n    const property = props1[i];\n\n    if (props1[property] !== props2[property]) {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return true;\n}\n\nconsole.log(isSameObject(user1, user2));  // true",

            answer:
              "A pseudo-element in CSS is similar to a pseudo-class in that it uses a keyword added to a selector, but he similarities end there. CSS pseudo-elements let us style a specific part of elements or even add to the beginning or end of the element. In addition, a pseudo-element will use double colons between the keyword and the selector. Technically, because this double-colon convention was not in place early on, the spec still allows this. That said, it is still expected that double colons are used.\n\n\nA few examples:\n\n::after - This creates an inline pseudo-element as the lst child of an element.\n\n::before - Similar to the above, this creates an inline pseudo-element as the first child of an element.\n\n::first-letter - This will apply styles to the first letter of the first line of an element.\n\n::first-line - This works like ::first-letter, but the style will apply to the whole line. What qualifies for the first line will depend on the width of the element, font size and other similar factors.\n\n::selection - When the user highlights a section, usually by clicking and dragging the mouse across text, we can style this highlighted area using the ::selection pseudo-element.\n\n\nDrop this example into an online editor, like https://codepen.io/pen/, to see a few of the pseudo-elements work their magic:\n\nCSS\n\tp::first-letter {\n\t\tfont-size: 50px;\n\t}\n\n\tp::first-line {\n\t\tcolor: orange;\n\t\tletter-spacing: 0.5em;\n\t}\n\n\tp::before {\n\t\tcontent: 'THIS IS BEFORE ---- ';\n\t\tcolor: darkblue;\n\t\tbackground-color: yellowgreen;\n\t}\n\n\tp::after {\n\t\tcontent: '--- THIS IS AFTER';\n\t\tbackground: gray;\n\t\tcolor: aquamarine;\n\t}\n\n\nHTML\n\t<p>The first line will be orange and have letter-spacing applied. The first line changes as the element size changes. The resat of the line will be black, except for the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements. \n\t</p>\n\n",

Promises allow values to be returned much like synchronous methods, just not immediately. In the interim, the Promise, acting as the placeholder, allow the program to move on and will then provide the results of the request whenever they are ready.\n\nA Promise is always either:\n\n    pending: This is the default state. No value is ready nor has anything been rejected.\n    fulfilled: This means the request was completed successfully and the results will be returned.\n    rejected: As it sounds, the operation failed. This will return a reason for the rejection.\n\nA few approaches to handle the results of Promises, we can either chain then() methods with a catch() or use Async/Await. Note: If using Async/Await, it is a good idea to wrap it in a try-catch block to handle a possible rejection.",

              'From Wikipedia:\n\nIn computing, tree shaking is a dead code elimination technique that is applied when optimizing code written in ECMAScript dialects like Dart, JavaScript, or TypeScript into a single bundle that is loaded by a web browser. Rather than eliminating code that can never be executed, tree shaking starts from entry point and includes only the code that is guaranteed to be executed.[1] It is succinctly described as "live code inclusion".\nHistory\n\nDead code elimination in dynamic languages is a much harder problem than in static languages. The idea of a "treeshaker" originated in LISP[2] in the 1990s. The idea is that all possible execution flows of a program can be represented as a tree of function calls, so that functions that are never called can be eliminated.\n\nThe algorithm was applied to JavaScript in Google Closure Tools and then to Dart in the dart2js compiler also written by Google, presented by Bob Nystrom in 2012[3][4] and described by the book "Dart in Action" by author Chris Buckett in 2013:\n\n    When code is converted from Dart to JavaScript the compiler does \'tree shaking\'. In JavaScript you have to add an entire library even if you only need it for one function, but thanks to tree shaking the Dart-derived JavaScript only includes the individual functions that you need from a library\n    — Chris Buckett\n\nThe next wave of popularity of the term is attributed to Rich Harris\'s Rollup project[5] developed in 2015.\nRelation to ECMAScript 6 modules\n\nThe popularity of tree shaking in JavaScript is based on the fact that in distinction from CommonJS modules, ECMAScript 6 module loading is static and thus the whole dependency tree can be deduced by statically parsing the syntax tree. Thus tree shaking becomes an easy problem. However, tree shaking does not only apply at the import/export level: it can also work at the statement level, depending on the implementation.[citation needed] ',

              "A clip from:\nhttps://www.katalon.com/resources-center/blog/ci-cd-introduction/\n\n\nCI/CD is the acronym for the combined practices of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). CI/CD practices are currently the most widely accepted choice to shorten software development and delivery cycle time.\n\n\nWhat is Continuous Integration?\n\nIn a CI practice, developers build, run, and test code on their own workstations before committing code to the version control repository. After changes are made to the repository, a chain of events is put into motion. A typical first step in this chain is to build the latest version of source code. If the build is successful, unit tests are executed. If unit testing succeeds, the build is deployed to test environments where system tests are performed (usually using automated tests). The team is notified about the status of this process, and a report is delivered to provide details, such as build number, defects, and the number of tests.\n\n\nWhat is Continuous Delivery?\n\nCD makes it possible to release builds to the production environment when needed. Allowing the team to deploy at will, CD effectively reduces time to market.\n\nBefore deploying software to production, the CD process includes performing automated system testing, unit testing (including API testing and load testing), and integration testing. The steps from CI to CD are usually completed automatically, including automated testing at the unit, integration, and system levels. As tests can fail at any level and environment, CI/CD must include a feedback channel to quickly report failures to developers.",

If we take pride in what we do, how we do it and how we treat others, we should be proud enough to talk about it.\n\nUltimately, we just need to give a brief bit of detail about why something about us or our work is good. "I am a hard worker" followed up with how teammates always know, perhaps even commented, that we would get the job done and meet deadlines. Perhaps a bit about how some colleagues have become good friends. Maybe a little highlighting of how a boss liked to throw complicated or new things at us because he or she knew how well we can handle ourselves. This will all, of course, be personal and unique, but the general idea is just to showcase the positive affects that our personality, work ethic and passion have had on the people we worked with and the companies we worked for.\n\n\n',

              'This question is sometimes asked because it is more of an intermediate to advanced topic, given that it deals with both how things are layered, how an element\'s parent affects this and how the position property setting can change things.\n\n\tHere are the basics to know:\n\t- z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky).\n\n\t- Elements usually stack with the items that are lower in the DOM appearing on top. z-index can change that for an element using a integer. The higher the number, the higher it goes on the element stack.\n\n\t- Understanding how the parent-child relationship works is very important for understanding how z-index will affect the elements. If element A has children, but element B sits on top of it, then no child element A can ever be higher than element B. No matter how high we make the z-index setting. \n\n\t- You can animate z-index, but it is either behind or in front of an element. It will not transition from one to the other. \n\n\tAn example that can be dropped into an online editor like https://codepen.io/pen/ :\n\n\n\t\tCSS\n\t\t\tdiv {\n\t\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\t\tbackground: black;\n\t\t\tcolor: white;\n\t\t\twidth: 100%;\n\t\t\ttop: 35%;\n\t\t\ttext-align: center;\n\t\t\tpadding: 1em\n\t\t}\n\n\t\timg {\n\t\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\t\tleft: 25%;\n\t\t\ttop: 0;\n\t\t\tz-index: -1;\n\t\t\tmargin: 0 auto;\n\t\t}\n\n\n\t\tHTML\n\t\t    <div><h1>Toggle the image\'s z-index property to watch it go backwards and forwards.</h1>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random" width="50%">\n',

              "Content Security Policy (CSP) is an HTTP header that allows site operators fine-grained control over where resources on their site can be loaded from. The use of this header is the best method to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Due to the difficulty in retrofitting CSP into existing websites, CSP is mandatory for all new websites and is strongly recommended for all existing high-risk sites.\n\nThe primary benefit of CSP comes from disabling the use of unsafe inline JavaScript. Inline JavaScript – either reflected or stored – means that improperly escaped user-inputs can generate code that is interpreted by the web browser as JavaScript. By using CSP to disable inline JavaScript, you can effectively eliminate almost all XSS attacks against your site.",

Some interviewers will press this and, possible, be somewhat abrasive and aggressive here. The idea is that they want to see if we know what makes us special, what makes us valuable and why we are a definite good investment. We need to articulate how strengths and be prepared for a reply that challenges this, perhaps like "Everyone does that...", or similar. This part of the interview is not really about our abilities with specific technologies, but more about how we make people around us better, how we have a strong positive impact on teams and how we will not just write the code that is needed, but use our passion, soft skills, and any other personal and professional traits to move projects and teams forward. This needs to be personal and positive.\n\n\n\tSome thoughts to guide this answer:\n\n\tWe are unique; make it obvious.\n\tWe have experience successfully working with others; make it known.\n\tWe have a desire for growth; show why that matters.\n\tWe have natural & leaned skills; relate them to the job and the team.\n\tWe have tremendous ability; showcase it.\n\tWe have passion; make it felt.\n\tWe make a positive impact.\n\tWe are an solid investment.',

              'From Wikipedia.org:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing\n\nA/B testing (also known as bucket testing or split-run testing) is a user experience research methodology. [1] A/B tests consist of a randomized experiment with two variants, A and B.[2][3] It includes application of statistical hypothesis testing or "two-sample hypothesis testing" as used in the field of statistics. A/B testing is a way to compare two versions of a single variable, typically by testing a subject\'s response to variant A against variant B, and determining which of the two variants is more effective.[4] \n\n\nHere is a nice excerpt from this article:\nhttps://crossbrowsertesting.com/blog/visual-testing/ab-testing-screenshots/\n\n"One of the more common testing practices that marketers experiment with is A/B testing, which lets you test two scenarios at once to determine which your audience responds to better. This is done by having control and variable scenarios, which are randomly displayed to users when they visit your site.\n\nThese changes can be as small as testing the color of a CTA button to seeing whether adding a video on a landing page will increase registrations. For example, one user may see a green “Sign Up Now” button, while the other sees a red one. During an A/B test, you may look to see which one gets more clicks in order to inform which color you want to set the button to."\n\nA/B testing tools from a list complied in:\nhttps://www.ventureharbour.com/best-a-b-testing-tools/\n\nGoogle Analytics & Google Optimize - Free\nOptimizely\nVWO\nZoho PageSense\nHubSpot\nLeadformly\nUnbounce\nConvertize\nKameleoon\nConvert\n',

            question: "",
            answer:
              'A very complete answer from:\nhttps://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-create-a-multicolor-text-in-html-and-css.html\n\nYou can create a multicolor text with the help of image editors such as Pixelmator, Photoshop and so on. So, you can create a multicolor image and embed it into your website.\nThe multicolor text will not be searchable with this method.\n\nAs a result, your code will look like the following:\n\n<img src="multicolortext.png"/>\n\nMake separate elements¶\n\nAnother way is creating a text with separate elements by using the HTML <span> tag, which is an empty container. This means that you create a multicolor text by putting each letter in a separate element to define a different color for each letter of your text.\nExample of creating a multicolor text with separate elements in HTML:¶\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Title of the document</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <span style="color:#FF0000">H</span>\n    <span style="color:#66CC66">e</span>\n    <span style="color:#FF9966">l</span>\n    <span style="color:#FFCCCC">l</span>\n    <span style="color:#FF0066">o</span>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\nTry it Yourself »\nResult¶\nUse CSS¶\n\nAnd finally, you can use CSS. This is the easiest way of creating such kind of text.\n\nPut your text in a <span> tag and give it a class name "multicolortext". Then, you need the CSS background-image property to add a gradient background to your text with its "linear-gradient" value, where you put the names of your preferred colors.\n\nTo get multicolor text instead of the multicolor background, you need to use the background-clip property, which lets you control how far a background image or color extends beyond the element\'s padding or content. This step gives some colors to your text, but not exactly what you want.\n\nYou can get the final result by making your text color transparent with the color property so that the background color will be reflected in the text.\nExample of creating a multicolor text with HTML and CSS:¶\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>The title of the document</title>\n    <style>\n      .multicolortext {\n        background-image: linear-gradient(to left, violet, indigo, green, blue, yellow, orange, red);\n        -webkit-background-clip: text;\n        -moz-background-clip: text;\n        background-clip: text;\n        color: transparent;\n      }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>\n      <span class="multicolortext">Let’s be creative!</span>\n    </h1>\n  </body>\n</html>',

This is an opportunity to drive home areas where the companies and our interests mesh nicely. In addition, knowing how we want to be better just one year from now can show a commitment to constant growth.\n- Give a brief outline of what your ideal professional self would be five years from now. Make it real and doable, but still a bit of a long reach. Unrealistic goals or extremely small goals are not going to help us look any better. High, but achievable, goals can be inspiring.\n- The five-year goals can include:\n\t\t- A higher understanding of certain principles.\n\t\t- More experience and deeper knowledge in one or two technologies (ideally ones that are associated with the job being considered).\n\t\t- A general increased role and professional status, like becoming a senior dev, leading a team or even entering into management.\n\t\t- One or two new languages, tools or processes that would build on the current ones (ideally meshing with what the company offers, if possible).\n\t\t- Certain experience within a team or some similar goal that relates to being even better working with others.\n\t\t- Conferences, talks, meetups, projects related to career path, etc.\n- Give a brief outline of what your ideal personal self would be five years from now. This can be anything at all and should definitely be genuine. Family life, personal project (writing a book, starting a group, etc), growing hobbies or adding new ones, physical fitness, etc.",

There are a number of methods including play() and pause() as well as load().\n\n- Text Track API: Picking up where the Media API leaves off, the Text Track API allows us to interact with text tracks (subtitles or captions) for the audio and videos.\n\n- Drag and Drop: There are a number of possibilities with this API. Among these, you can add  'draggable' attribute to allow a user to move an element then have event handlers in place on a drop zone so the browser knows where the element can be dropped.\n\n- History API: This spec gives developers more control of the user's browser session. Along with moving the the user forward or backward, we can check the length of the history and even add or remove entries. We can hold data enabling us to restore a page or just update the URL without refreshing the page.\n",

              'Accessibility has become a very big focus for many companies. Knowing they are hiring people that can support this effort is important. The goal for an answer to any question about accessibility is to show that we have a basic understanding combined with being able to about real-world use.\n\nAccessibility is no longer just something nice to incorporate, it is essential for making sure people, best practices and, in some cases, laws are being respected. \n\nA few accessibility features we can incorporate:\n\nThoughtful contrasting colors for people who have trouble seeing color. This allows them to see a difference between two colored areas.\n\nAria labels are important for signalling correct detail to screen readers.\n\nUsing tags instead of CSS properties, like <em> instead of font-weight, will signal to screen-readers the intent to emphasis. This can then be past along to the user.\nThere are tools available, like Lighthouse now included in Chrome Dev Tools, that can run scans and alert us to accessibility concerns.\n\n\nHere is an example of the <em> and an aria label:\n\n\n    <p>Hi my name is Sheev Palpatine, but you can call me <em>EMPORER DARTH SIDIOUS</em></p>\n\n    <button aria-label="Close Modal">Close</button>',

HTTP2 adds a number of features to manage the streams, but leaves old semantics untouched.\n\n\nHTTP/2 supports queries multiplexing, headers compression, priority and more intelligent packet streaming management. This results in reduced latency and accelerates content download on modern web pages.",

This is usually not a good idea as it creates difficult to edit document with potentially inconsistent styling. It is important to separate concerns for multi-faceted projects like web pages.\n\n\t<h1 style="color: blue;">Example</h1>\n\n- <style> tags in the documents <head> can be used to assign selectors to declarations. The browser will then link classes used on the elements in the <body> to the selectors in the <style> tag. This will apply CSS to the page.\n\n\tThis is better than inline styles, but still not ideal as we are not separating the styling from the structure.\n\n\t<style>\n        .selector-name {\n            color: red;\n        }\n    </style>\n\n- The most versatile, clear and maintainable method is using external style sheets. We can bring these in using a <link> tag in the document\'s <head>. The browser will then using the selctors in the external style sheet to link to classes on the page elements and apply the associated declarations.\n\n\tThe most versatile, clear and maintainable because it enables a sheet, or sheets, with only CSS-related material. We can group selectors as we see fit and even separate them into separate sheets when the need arises. If anyone ever needs to jump in, they will have a much easier time finding what they need and making changes over the inline or <style> tag methods.\n\n\t<link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css">\n',

This can sometimes be concerning for a company as they might think that makes us a short-term investment or, much worse, a bad investment due to some inability to get along with people or perform.\nThis question is our opportunity to remove these doubts. A simple explanation can go a long way, even if there was a bad situation and we can speak to how we learned from it.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with wanting to make more money or move up in role or even just find a culture that meshes better with our values, work ethic and/or future goals. We just need to give a brief reasoning that includes our thoughts surrounding big moves, our steps to work with our current employer before making th e moves and how those decisions ended up being good or, perhaps, lessons that we learned from those that did not.\n\nUltimately, we don't want to lie or give the impression we are trying to cover anything up. There are always reasons and many of them are good reasons. Taking advantage of opportunities for personal or professional advancement are definitely good reasons.

            answer:
              "This question is designed to see our thought process on this issue.\n\nHere are some basic steps for approaching a slow app:\n\n\t1. Define the specific problem. What, specifically is slow? Is the initial load slow? Are page transitions slow? Do the interactions, like menu animations, seem slow or choppy? Does this occur on only some browsers or devices? \n\n\t\tUltimately, the goal here is to get as clear a picture as possible as of each part that is slow. This enables us to find the best spots to begin drilling down.\n\n\t2. Narrow the scope: Next we want to take our drill-down points and begin to narrow each of those to as small a piece of code as we can. \n\n\t\tFor instance, if the issue is slow loading, a good place to start is either Chrome Dev Tools' Lighthouse tool or a page speed analyzer. One popular one is: \n\n\t\thttps://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/\n\n\t\tThese tools can help see where it is slow, like the first paint or how long until a user can actually interact with the page. From there it can help us pinpoint potential problem areas, like large images or slow server response.\n\n\t\tin a browser's dev tools we can use other tools, like the Network section to see detail on specific items like when they loaded, how long they took and if they were blocking progress. \n\n\t\tIf the issue is something not related to resources loading, dev tools can help narrow down the search using the Debugger, Performance, Inspector, Console and others. \n\n\t3. Isolate: Once we gained an understanding of the specific symptoms and then narrowed the scope of our attention, we can now address these specific areas of code. Dev tools Debugger can be great for stepping through JavaScript. The Performance tool can help see how an animation affects the page processing. \n\n\t\tIf need be, it can help to isolate specific blocks of code in a separate editor, perhaps even an online editor like repl.it, codepen.io or jsbin.com. This can help zero-in on specific problems in the code.\n\t\tAlong the same line of thinking, commenting out blocks of code and/or temporarily inserting new simplified code can help ensure we have properly identified the problem area.\n\n\t4. Fix: By this point, we have arrived at the problem pieces of code. Now, we just need to correct the issue.\n\n\t5. Test...a lot: We have not fixed the problem at this point. We have only written the code that we think will correct the issue. Test. Test. Test then take a break...test again. At that point, we have fixed teh issue.",

              'There are a wide array of strategies for this answer. Below are a few basic approaches, though a web search (click the "More About this Question" button for that) will yield a wealth of detail and other options.\n\n- We can just give an amount we would like to make and we think we are worth. it is simple and direct, though it might be a factor in eliminating us from the candidate list if the number far exceeds what the company wants to spend on the position or thinks we are worth. This approach is not concerned with staying in market value. It is more about weeding out companies that can not or do not wish to pay what we value our services at. \n\n- We can take our current salary and just raise that a little. Assuming we are applying for a similar position, or even slightly elevated, this keeps us around market range. \n\n- If the job is meant to be an entry into a new career, pushing for more money might hurt the greater purpose. We might want to consider looking for the salary range listed in the job post and speaking to an amount towards the middle, with a minimum around the listed minimum. Or, perhaps, if our situation is one where little more or less would not matter and getting in the door is the focus, being honest about this can be OK. It would be best to also ask how soon someone is eligible for a raise and to make sure they do not offer below their posted minimum. There are some who would say never ask for or imply the offered minimum, but getting the first foot in can make a tremendous difference and then enable us to make the next interview about what we are really worth.\n\n- Use online tools to find a market salary range and then ask for a salary somewhere between the average and the top salary depending on where our skills and experience put us.\n\n\n\tA few tools for finding market value:\n\n\t\tGlassDoor: https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/index.htm\n\t\tPayScale: https://www.payscale.com/my/survey/choose\n\t\tLinkedin Salary Tool: https://www.linkedin.com/salary/',

            answer:
              'This answer comes from:\nhttps://resource-centre.net/html5-tutorials/bullet-point-lists/\n\nBullet Point Lists (or Unordered Lists)\n\nThe first kind of list we will look at is using bullets.\nUnordered List – the <ul> Tag\n\nBullet point lists are also known as unordered lists (UL) because there is no numbering involved. That is why a bulleted list uses the <ul> </ul> tag pair. Here is a basic example:\n\nThe whole list is surrounded by <ul> </ul> for a start. When you open your list tag, make sure you automatically type your closing tag and then proceed to fill your items between them.\nThe type Attribute\n\nThe type attribute determines what kind of bullet you are seeing on the page. Although through CSS you can specify a wide-range of bullet styles, and even use your own image, in raw HTML it is best to stick with the common types which are\n\n    type="circle" – an unfilled circle\n\n    type="disc" – a filled circle\n\n    type="square" – a filled square\n\nList Items – the <li> Tag\n\nEach individual item in your list is wrapped in its own <li> </li> tag pair. You can often get away without the </li> but I would recommend keeping it in, just so you maintain healthy coding habit.\n\nThe list above I placed in individual <ul> but each <li> also supports the type attribute, such that I could create\n\n    Square\n    Disc\n    Circle\n\nNot sure why you would want to do that, but you can if you want to!\n\nBullet List Indentation\n\nBefore you apply any CSS to your list, HTML (or more accurately, your browser) will apply indentation to your list, so it stands out from your normal paragraph <p> tags.\nOrdered / Numbered Lists – the <ol> Tag\n\nIf you want to present your list in an ordered fashion, then the <ol> tag is your friend. By default this will give you a numbered list, but the type attribute gives you flexibility, in the same way as bullet point lists do.\n\nwhich outputs\n\n    Item 1\n    Item 2\n    Item 3\n\nThe type attribute offers a few more options in ordered lists compared to bulleted ones. A bit more guidance on this can be obtained at W3Schools.\nStarting an Ordered List On A Different Number\n\nSay you were putting together some instructions to build a table. You may want to use a numbered list to achieve this. However, if you wanted to put images and extra text between each stage, you would probably need multiple lists. The problem is that each list starts at number 1 (or letter A) by default. That would screw up your instructions!\n\nThankfully HTML has the start property to allow you to start on a subsequent number:\n\nThis outputs:\n\n    Step Four\n    Step Five\n    Step Six\n\nReversing The Order\n\nIf you want to show your numbers (or letters) in reverse order, then this is really easy too. You might want to do a ‘Top 10’ with your best item announced last, for example. This can be done by adding the word reversed into your Ordered List opening tag:\n\nAnd this would make your list look like this:\n\n    First LI\n    Second LI\n    Third LI\n    Fourth LI\n    Fifth LI\n\nMulti-Level Bullet List in HTML\n\nWith patchy browser support (and sometimes undone by CSS in some sites) you can create a multilevel list. This is achieved by embedding one list inside another:\n\nWhich creates:\n\n    Top Level Item\n        Sub-Item 1\n        Sub-Item 2\n    Top Level Item\n\nYou can use a combination of <ul> and <ol>. That may be useful if you want bullet points under a numbered list.\n\n    Top Level Item\n        Sub-Item 1\n        Sub-Item 2\n    Top Level Item\n',

In either case, we need to work into the interview an example or two that showcases our ability to work with others. Overall, we want to exhibit good communication skills, and a brief bit about how important we think communication skills are when working with teams, or our superiors, the client, etc can help. Perhaps even a story about a time when kept our calm when others did not, or an example of how we set aside things that bothered us, and were able to generate harmony that helped move a project forward. All of this needs to be delivered, like all of our answers, with good eye contact without staring, enthusiasm married with a calm and thoughtful approach and general good will and respectful manner. These qualities can mean a lot to a company and can raise our profile above others in the eyes of the interviewer.\n",

              'The following excerpt come from bitofco.de:\nhttps://bitsofco.de/understanding-the-virtual-dom/\n\nWhy do we need a virtual DOM?\n\nTo understand why the concept of the virtual DOM arose, let’s revisit the original DOM. As I mentioned, there are two parts to the DOM - the object-based representation of the HTML document and the API to manipulating that object.\n\nFor example, let’s take this simple HTML document with an unordered list and one list item.\n\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang="en">\n <head></head>\n <body>\n    <ul class="list">\n        <li class="list__item">List item</li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\n\nThis document can be represented as the following DOM tree:\n\nhtml\nhead lang="en"\nbody\nul class="list"\nli class="list__item"\n"List item"\n\nLet’s say we want to modify the content of the first list item to \n"List item one"\n and also add a second list item. To do this, we will need use the DOM APIs to find the elements we want to update, create the new elements, add attributes and content, then finally update the DOM elements themselves.\n\nconst listItemOne = document.getElementsByClassName("list__item")[0];\nlistItemOne.textContent = "List item one";\n\nconst list = document.getElementsByClassName("list")[0];\nconst listItemTwo = document.createElement("li");\nlistItemTwo.classList.add("list__item");\nlistItemTwo.textContent = "List item two";\nlist.appendChild(listItemTwo);\n\nThe DOM wasn’t made for this…\n\nWhen the first specification for the DOM was released in 1998, we built and managed web pages in very differently. There was far less reliance on the DOM APIs to create and update the page content as frequently as we do today.\n\nSimple methods such as \ndocument.getElementsByClassName()\n are fine to use on a small scale, but if we are updating multiple elements on a page every few seconds, it can start to become really expensive to constantly query and update the DOM.\n\nEven further, because of the way the APIs are setup, it is usually simpler to perform more expensive operations where we update larger parts of the document than to find and update the specific elements. Going back to our list example, it is in some ways easier to replace the entire unordered list with a new one than to modify the specific elements.\n\nconst list = document.getElementsByClassName("list")[0];\nlist.innerHTML = `\n<li class="list__item">List item one</li>\n<li class="list__item">List item two</li>\n`;\n\n\nIn this particular example, the performance difference between the methods is probably insignificant. However, as the size of the web page grows, it becomes more important to only select and update what is needed.\n\n… but the virtual DOM was!\n\nThe virtual DOM was created to solve these problems of needing to frequently update the DOM in a more performant way. Unlike the DOM or the shadow DOM, the virtual DOM isn\'t an official specification, but rather a new method of interfacing with the DOM.\n\nA virtual DOM can be thought of as a copy of the original DOM. This copy can be frequently manipulated and updated, without using the DOM APIs. Once all the updates have been made to the virtual DOM, we can look at what specific changes need to be made to the original DOM and make them in a targetted and optimised way.',

In the common case of HTML, the rendering engine parses HTML and CSS, and displays the parsed content on the screen.\n\n    Networking: network calls such as HTTP requests, using different implementations for different platform behind a platform-independent interface.\n\n    UI backend: This exposes a generic interface that is not platform specific. Underneath it uses operating system user interface methods all for drawing basic items like combo boxes and windows. \n\n    JavaScript interpreter: Used to parse and execute JavaScript code.\n\n    Data storage: The browser may need to save all sorts of data locally, such as cookies. Browsers also support storage mechanisms such as localStorage, IndexedDB, WebSQL and FileSystem.\n\nThe flow:\n\n           | <--------  USER INTERFACE\t\t\t\t________\nUI BACKEND |\t                 V\t\t\t\t\t     DATA\n           |            BROWSER ENGINE --------->  STORAGE\n           |                  V\t\t\t\t       ---------\n           | <------   RENDERING ENGINE\n                         V\t        V\t        \t\n                  NETWORKING   JAVASCRIPT INTERPRETER    \n",

We just need to show we understand the general process.\n\n- We initiate a request using the domain name system with the URL as an address. \n- The server that houses the address will be located via the internet and the request is made.\n- The server then serves up the requested data.\n- The data is transferred via the web back to the browser.\n- \t\n\n\n- The web browser that you are using will contact a DNS (Domain Name System) server.\n- The DNS will translate the website name into a numeric IP address (every website domain name is basically an alias for an IP address). \n- The IP address is sent to the browser.\n- The browser uses this IP address to locate the server hosting the web page and, using the TCP protocol, opens a connection via port 80 on the server. In some cases, authentication can be part of this connection. This might be a JSON web token, or some other data, included in the request.\n- The server will then send the requested data to the browser.\n- The browser will then render the page to the screen. \n\n- The new web page might include dependencies, like CSS ot JavaScript sheets, or images, etc. The browser will then either request these via the same connection, or, if the begin the process for a new connection to retrieve each item.\n\n- Once the browser page (tab or window) is closed, the connection to the server ends.\n\n",

            answer:
              "instanceof is used to determine the prototype origin of an object; basically the class that created it.\n\nPopper use would be:\nclass Circle {}\nconst circle = new Circle();\n\nconsole.log(circle instanceof Circle);  //true\nconsole.log(circle instanceof Object);  //true\n\n\nHere is how it can be misused: Some will try to use it instead of typeof. It will not always give the expected results when used for that and should never be attempted.\nIn the example below, we see how it can work like typeof and then how it will not work in two scenarios that appear almost the same.\n\t\nconsole.log(new String('Hello World')  instanceof String);  // true\n\nconsole.log('hello world' instanceof String);  // false",

              'Excerpts from w3.org:\n\nThe World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community where Member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop Web standards. Led by Web inventor and Director Tim Berners-Lee and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe, W3C\'s mission is to lead the Web to its full potential.\n\n\nWhat does W3C do?\n\nW3C\'s primary activity is to develop protocols and guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the Web. W3C\'s standards define key parts of what makes the World Wide Web work. Learn more about W3C\'s mission.\nWhere is W3C located?\n\nW3C does not have a single physical headquarters. There are four institutions, however, that "host" W3C: MIT (in Cambridge, MA, USA), ERCIM (in Sophia-Antipolis, France), Keio University (near Tokyo, Japan), and Beihang University (in Beijing, China).\n\nThe W3C staff is distributed around the world, but there are concentrations of people in Cambridge, Massachusetts (USA), Sophia-Antipolis (France), and Tokyo (Japan). In addition, W3C is represented in 17 other regions of the world via representatives based at organizations. W3C calls these regional points of contact "W3C Offices."\nHow is W3C funded?\n\nW3C receives funds from:\n\n    W3C Member dues\n    Research grants and other sources of private and public funding\n    Individual donations of money and equipment \n\nWhat is the difference between the Web and the Internet?\n\nFrom the definition in the Wikipedia: "The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that interchange data by packet switching using the standardized Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)."\n\nThus, the Internet is a network of networks, defined by the TPC/IP standards.\n\nThe Web, on the other hand, is defined in W3C\'s Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume I as follows: "The World Wide Web (WWW, or simply Web) is an information space in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI)."\n\nThus, the Web is an information space. The first three specifications for Web technologies defined URLs, HTTP, and HTML.\n',

            answer:
              'All of this addresses the loading of documents and how they affect the main document.\n\nFrom:https://javascript.info/script-async-defer\n\n\nDEFER:\n\nThe defer attribute tells the browser not to wait for \nthe script. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, \nbuild DOM. The script loads “in the background”, and then runs when the \nDOM is fully built.\n\nHere’s the same example with defer:\n<p>...content before script...</p>\n\n<scrip/t defer src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js?speed=1"></scrip/t>\n\n<!-- visible immediately -->\n<p>...content after script...</p>\n\n\nIn other words:\n\n    - Scripts with defer never block the page.\n    - Scripts with defer always execute when the DOM is ready (but before DOMContentLoaded event).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASYNC\n\nThe async attribute is somewhat like \ndefer. It also makes the script non-blocking. But it has important differences in the behavior.\n\nThe async attribute means that a script is completely independent:\n\n    - The browser doesn’t block on async scripts (like defer).\n    - Other scripts don’t wait for async scripts, and async scripts don’t wait for them.\n    - DOMContentLoaded and async scripts don’t wait for each other:\n        | DOMContentLoaded may happen both before an async script (if an async script finishes loading after the page is complete)\n        | …or after an async script (if an async script is short or was in HTTP-cache)\n\n    <p>...content before scripts...</p>\n\n    <scrip/t>\n      document.addEventListener(\'DOMContentLoaded\', () => alert("DOM ready!"));\n    </scrip/t>\n\n    <scrip/t async src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js"></scrip/t>\n    <scrip/t async src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/small.js"></scrip/t>\n\n    <p>...content after scripts...</p>\n\n\n\nThe following examples come from: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/html-preload-prefetch\n\n\n    \nPRELOAD\n\nPreloading JavaScript resources is done differently. This example, taken from this Google Developers article on preloading, shows this:\nindex.html\n\n<link rel="preload" href="used-later.js" as="scrip/t">\n<!-- ... -->\n<scrip/t>\n  var usedLaterScript = document.createElement(\'script\');\n  usedLaterScript.src = \'used-later.js\';\n  document.body.appendChild(usedLaterScript);\n</scrip/t>\n\n\n\nPREFETCH\n\nPrefetching works similarly to preloading. The difference is that, \nwhen prefetching a resource, the browser considers the resource to be \nlow priority. This means that the resource or asset will load a bit \nlater. Because of this, prefetching is usually implemented with \nresources that are not required initially, but are used at a later \npoint.\n\nTo implement prefectching in your HTML page, change the value of \nrel to "prefetching.\n\nindex.html\n<link\n  rel="prefetch"\n  as="style"\n  onload="this.rel = \'stylesheet\'"\n  href=\'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:100,900|Material+Icons\'>\n',

              'This is generally asked to get an idea of how much someone pays attention to good practices and, ultimately, will write easier to understand code and have an easier time jumping into someone else\'s code.\n\nGeneral naming conventions:\n-\tNames should be brief, but descriptive enough that the average non-developer could understand. For example, using "d = new Date()" might serve brevity, but can make no sense later in the program and require extra effort to understand. Conversely, "theDateForTheDayTheAppIsRun = new Date()" is clear, but unnecessarily long. Simply "todaysDate = new Date()" is brief and easily understood.\n\nA few JavaScript examples can be:\n- Camel case for variables: const lastName = \'Kenobi\'\n- Pascal case for classes: class MainCharacter { }\n- "is" or "has" prefix for booleans.\n- Function calls that will be returning something can start with have a descriptive verb ("update", "get", etc).\n- As few variables as possible. This is not really a naming convention, but it greatly affects the abilty for the names of the variables that do get used to be easier to follow and keep track of.\n- Do not re-use variable names.\n- In many cases it is better not to make a variable equal itself with modification. This can be difficult to follow through and can often be better served with a new, variable descriptively named to match the newly formed data.\n- When reasonable, if a specific item in an array is being used, assign a more descriptive variable: const updatedFileId = changes[0]\n- Property names that do not need to be prefixed with the class name. \n\tWe do not need: class Car {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructor(brand, purchaseDate) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.carName = brand;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.carYear = purchaseDate;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n} \n\tInstead, we can use: class Car {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructor(brand) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.name = brand;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.year = purchaseDate;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t} \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t// in use it will still be descriptive\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconst myCar = new Car();\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmyCar,name = \'Jeep\';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmyCar.year = \'2017\';\n- Avoid "magic" numbers, or numbers without a name, when possible. \n\tWe want to avoid: const forwardMovement = duration * 3;\n\tWe can use: const rate = 3;\n\t\t\t\t  forwardMovement = duration * rate;\n\t\t\t\t \n\nCSS & HTML examples:\n- Use nicely cascading rules to make for as few selectors as possible.\n- Kabab case for selectors: .inner-wrap\n- Descriptive selector names. This can be the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) method or similar.\n- Try to avoid using the same name for an ID and a class. These are technically independent from each other, but this can cause confusion for a developer.\n',

In an object literal, the spread syntax enumerates the properties of an object and adds the key-value pairs to the object being created.\n\nSpread syntax looks exactly like rest syntax. In a way, spread syntax is the opposite of rest syntax. Spread syntax "expands" an array into its elements, while rest syntax collects multiple elements and "condenses" them into a single element.

              'This might sound like a silly question, but questions like this sometimes are used to get us to show our understanding of basic, but often needed, aspects of CSS. This will usually be a screening question, so a descriptive verbal outline will needed, not actual code.\n\nTo begin, we need to target our element via ID, or by class for multiple elements. We then want to set an equal width and height, perhaps 100px each. From there, we can either set the border for a few pixels or a background color or even both. This way we can see it. At that point, we have a square.\n\nMaking that square a circle simply requires a border-radius of 50% all of the way around. \n\nNow, that is a fixed width square or circle. We could make it responsive by using a percentage as the width and an equal percentage as padding-bottom. If there is content in the square or circle, one way to keep the sides equal would be to absolutely position the content. Ultimately, this is just an option. There are many ways to approach graphics in CSS, and purpose and the rest of the document will play into a plan for making the graphics responsive.\n\n\nPaste this example into an online editor, like https://codepen.io/pen/, to see the square and circle:\n\n\tCSS\n\t\t.square {\n\t\t\tbackground: lightgreen;\n\t\t\twidth: 50%;\n\t\t\tpadding-bottom: 50%;\n\t\t\tmargin: 0 auto;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t.square.circle {\n\t\t\tborder-radius: 50%;\n\t\t\tbackground: salmon;\n\t\t}\n\n\tHTML\n\t\t<div class="square"></div>\n\n\t\t<div class="square circle"></div>',

            answer:
              "The days of great consideration being paid to Internet Explorer's many differences will, or possibly have, come to an end. This does not mean browser compatibility is no longer a concern. \nModern browsers are much more consistent with including features, but it is still good to check with a tool like https://caniuse.com/ or MDN to make sure new features are well covered.\n\nFor most browsers, we can easily download them and test our app. But what about older versions of each browser? What about these browsers on different devices. What if we need to test on Safari, but do not have access to a Mac? There are tools like https://www.browserstack.com/ to test web apps in many different ways. Some will even monitor real users on different browsers and devices. We can even have automated routines to test these scenarios.  \n\nBeyond testing, it is important that we know well what our target audience is going to be. If it is truly a global reach we are seeking, we need to consider things like Opera Mini (popular in parts of the world with slow internet), Baidu (a popular China-based browser), KaiOS' browser (mobile OS and browser used all over and especially in India) and any others that are used.\n\nAll of this does not mean that wide-reach intentions mean we need to remove most of our JavaScript just to make the app work right on Opera Mini. It just means just that we need to consider what happens to our product for the those users and work towards good solutions. \n\nWhithin any app, we should pay attention to current browser compatibility and utilize thinking along these lines:\n\n\t- We might just need to ensure there are fullbacks in place.\n\n\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\tposition: sticky; // Not fully supported by some browsers\n\n\t- We can plan our interactions and layouts so that nothing critical relies on technology not fully supported.\t\n\n\t- We can check for specific feature support in a browser and have separate functionality ready. This is not ideal as it requires extra consideration when maintaining the web app, but it is a workable solution.\n\n\t- We and the customer can consider the costs vs the gains related to supporting certain browsers. The benefits might not offset the costs of supporting a specific browser's use and/or the areas of the world it is popular.",

              'Some browsers accept additional proprietary non-standard non-css syntax on top of the usual css. Less is build on top of standard css and therefore may not recognize it. You may also need to put an otherwise non-parseable value inside a variable and use it to dynamically build selector or other css part during compilation time.\n\nEscaping allows you to use any arbitrary string as property or variable value. It can be used also to dynamically build selectors, but that feature is deprecated and replaced by different more powerful option.\n\nSyntax\n\nUse either ~"whatever" or ~\'whatever\' syntax to escape property values. Anything between quotes is used as is with almost no changes. The "as is" rule has one exception: string interpolation works with the usual @{variableName} syntax.\n\nUsed as Property Value\n\nSample input:\n\n@variable: "dynamic";\nh1 {\n  margin: 1 ~"2 2" 3;\n  padding: ~\'ms:special.syntax()\';\n  text: ~\'@{variable}\'; //interpolation works\n}\n\ncompiles into:\n\nh1 {\n  margin: 1 2 2 3;\n  padding: ms:special.syntax();\n  text: dynamic;\n}\n\n',

              "Excerpts from hacker.io:\n\nCSS was originally released in 1996 and consists of properties for adding font properties such as typeface and emphasis color of text, backgrounds, and other elements. CSS2 was released in 1998 with added styles for other media types so that it can be used for page layout designing. CSS3 was released in 1999 and presentation-style properties were added in it that allows you to build a presentation from documents.\n\nUnlike CSS2, which was comprised of a single document, CSS3 has its specifications divided into many individual modules, which makes CSS3 a whole lot easier to handle.\n\nWith CSS3, the designers can now use special fonts, like those available in Google Fonts and Typecast. Earlier, with CSS and CSS2, designers could only use “web-safe fonts” for being 100% sure to use fonts that would always display the same on every machine.\n\nWhile CSS and CSS2 had ‘simple selectors’, CSS3 calls the components as ‘a sequence of simple selectors’.\n\nCSS3 came up with some key web design considerations like rounded borders that help in rounding up the borders without any hassle. This turned out to be a huge plus point for developers who were struggling with initial versions of CSS borders.\n\nCSS3 has the capability to split text sections into multiple columns so that it can be read like a newspaper. In CSS2, the developers had difficulty because the standard was not equipped with automatically breaking the text so that it fits within a box.\n\n",

              'Synchronous code runs from top to bottom in order. One line, command, function, etc is processed and resolved before moving to the next. This can be problematic if you encounter "blocking" code, which is code that causes processing one item for a longer amount of time. This means the rest of the program (and end user) wait until the program can mover on to the next line. This is where asynchronous code can be helpful.\n\nAsynchronous code runs separately from other code. This means it can take longer to process without "blocking" the rest of the program from running. In JavaScript, the Call Stack processes code synchronously. If a piece of asynchronous code is encountered, it is moved out of the Call Stack. If it is part of a Web API, like setTimeOut(), then the browser handles the resolving the code. Otherwise, it is moved to the Callback Que. In either case, the Event Loop will take the next item that has resolved, and place it on the Call Stack. This time, when the code can be dealt with in order because it is ready and will not block the processing the rest of the program.',

              "A few basic elements of design are:    \n\n\nLINE – The linear marks made with a pen or brush or the edge created when two shapes meet.    \n\n\nSHAPE – A shape is a self contained defined area of geometric (squares and circles), or organic (free formed shapes or natural shapes). A positive shape automatically creates a negative shape.    \n\n\nDIRECTION – All lines have direction – Horizontal, Vertical or Oblique. Horizontal suggests calmness, stability and tranquility. Vertical gives a feeling of balance, formality and alertness. Oblique suggests movement and action    \n\n\nSIZE – Size is simply the relationship of the area occupied by one shape to that of another.    \n\n\nTEXTURE – Texture is the surface quality of a shape – rough, smooth, soft hard glossy etc.    \n\n\nCOLOR – Color is light reflected off objects. Color has three main characteristics: hue or its name (red, green, blue, etc.), value (how light or dark it is), and intensity (how bright or dull it is).",

            answer:
              "Closure is an inner function, that is accessible outside of its parent function's scope while maintaining its connection to the parent's variables and other data. This can be don to keep some data private and purposely expose other data.\nTo accomplish this, an anonymous function can be immediately invoked. In this function, data we wish to keep  private can be processed. Usually this data would be removed from memory via JavaScript's \"garbage collection\" memory clearing process. If this function returns a function, let's call it a child function, that accesses data from the parent function, the parent's data will remain in memory. In this situation, the only access to the parent function's data will be via whatever had been set up in the child function. In addition, every time the child function is invoked, a new function scope is created for the child function. The parent function scope is only created once. This means that we can invoke the child function to change a variable in the parent and the next time we invoke the child function the variable in the parent will still reflect the change. \n\nThis can be considered state management and might not be as useful today given other options to manage state. Still, this process can be used to protect sensitive data or even just a to keep a counter variable from being accidentally increased.\n\nSome examples\n// For comparison, this is a counter without closure\nlet counter = 0;\n\nfunction add1 () {\n\tcounter++;\n\treturn counter;\n}\n\nconsole.log(add1());  // 1\nconsole.log(add1());  // 2\n// The counter becomes unpredictable when it can be altered elswhere\ncounter++;\nconsole.log(add1());  // 4\n\n\n// This is a counter with closure\nconst add1 = (function () {\n  let counter = 0;\n\n  return function () {\n\tcounter++;\n\treturn counter;\n  };\n})();\nconsole.log(add1());  // 1\nconsole.log(add1());  // 2\nconsole.log(add1());  // 3\ncounter++;// error: counter is not defined\nconsole.log(add1());\n\n// Another, more complex example\n// In this travelAgent() in the child function made available, while \n// the \"trip\" variable and agent() function are accessible through \n// travelAgent(). The book() function, is only accessible through agent().\nfunction vacation() {\n\tvar trip;\n\n\tfunction travelAgent(itinerary) {\n\t\tagent(itinerary);\n\t\treturn trip;\n\t}\n\n\tfunction agent(itinerary) {\n\t\tif (itinerary === 'Orlando') {\n\t\t\ttrip = ['Orlando', 'Disney', 'Universal'];\n\t\t\tbook();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tfunction book() {\n\t\ttrip.push('booked');\n\t}\n\treturn travelAgent;\n}\n\nvar myVacation = vacation();\n\nconsole.log(myVacation('Orlando'));\n\n// Array [ \"Orlando\", \"Disney\", \"Universal\", \"booked\" ]\n",

              "S.O.L.I.D is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin.\n\nS - Single-responsiblity principle. A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.\n\nO - Open-closed principle. Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.\n\nL - Liskov substitution principle. Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.\n\nI - Interface segregation principle. A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.\n\nD - Dependency Inversion Principle. Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.\n\nHere is a good article on the subject: https://dev.to/francescoxx/solid-principles-in-javascript-3pek\n",

              'The best way to answer this question is with a bit of detail about each part of the process, though fine detail is not needed.\n- There are fonts available on the web, with Google Fonts being a common example. There are many other free and paid font sources. \n- We need to download the font documents or get a CDN URL.\n- These can be loaded ito our app via a <link> tag in our <head> section of our HTML sheet:\n\n\t<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Mulish:wght@200&display=swap" rel="stylesheet"> \n\n\tOr, using @import in our style sheet:\n\n\t@import url(\'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Mulish:wght@200&display=swap\');\n\n\n\tOr, if we wish to define a custom font typeface, we can do so using @font-face. This can be very useful, especially if the font is not a web font. For more info on @font-face and when to use it, check this out: \n\n\t\t\thttps://designmodo.com/font-face/\n\n\t\tFor detail on the difference between a typefacr and a font, read this:\n\n\t\t\thttps://www.howtogeek.com/325644/whats-the-difference-between-a-font-a-typeface-and-a-font-family/\n\n\t\tHere is how to set it up:\n\n\t\t@font-face {\n\t\t  font-family: "Open Sans";\n\t\t  src: url("/fonts/OpenSans-Regular-webfont.woff2") format("woff2"),\n\t\t       url("/fonts/OpenSans-Regular-webfont.woff") format("woff");\n\t\t}\n\n\t- We can apply any of the above using the following syntax in our style sheet:\n\n\t\tfont-family: \'Mulish\', sans-serif;\n',

              "Advantages\n\n    Sass facilitates you to write clean, easy and less CSS in a programming construct.\n    It contains fewer codes so you can write CSS quicker.\n    It is more stable, powerful, and elegant because it is an extension of CSS. So, it is easy for designers and developers to work more efficiently and quickly.\n    It is compatible with all versions of CSS. So, you can use any available CSS libraries.\n    It provides nesting so you can use nested syntax and useful functions like color manipulation, math functions and other values.\n\nDisadvantages\n\n    The developer must have enough time to learn new features present in this preprocessor before using it.\n    Using Sass may result in the loss of some benefits of a browser's built-in element inspector.",

            answer:
              "This addresses what happens when passing data from one variable to another. More specifically, this is about where variables point. \n\nThe original variable points to a place in memory. The new variable can either point to the same place in memory, which means the reference to the data was passed, or the new variable can point to a new place in memory that contains the same data, which means the values were passed to the new memory location.\n\nThe main reason this is important is shown by the results of changing either variable. If only a reference was passed, meaning both variables point to the same data at the same memory location, then changing a value will change change it for both variables, as well as any others pointing to the same place in memory.\n\nIf the actual values were passed and reside at a new location in memory, changing the values at the new memory location will only be visible with the new variable (and any others pointing to that location). The original variable is still pointing at the old memory location and remains unchanged.\n\nExamples:\nlet example1 = 1;\nlet example2 = example1;\nexample2++;\n\nconsole.log(example1, ' - ', example2);\n\nconst example3 = {\n  weapon: 'lightsaber'\n};\nconst example4 = {\n  ...example3\n};\nexample4.name = 'Darth Vader';\nconsole.log(example3, ' - ', example4);",

The offset does not affect the position of any other elements; thus, the space given for the element in the page layout is the same as if position were static. \n\nThis value creates a new stacking context when the value of z-index is not auto.

It is positioned relative to the initial containing block established by the viewport, except when one of its ancestors has a transform, perspective, or filter property set to something other than none (see the CSS Transforms Spec), in which case that ancestor behaves as the containing block. (Note that there are browser inconsistencies with perspective and filter contributing to containing block formation.) Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left. \n\nThis value always creates a new stacking context.

The offset does not affect the position of any other elements. \n\nThis value always creates a new stacking context. Note that a sticky element "sticks" to its nearest ancestor that has a "scrolling mechanism" (created when overflow is hidden, scroll, auto, or overlay), even if that ancestor isn\'t the nearest actually scrolling ancestor.

              "Here is a video introduction to hooks:\nhttps://youtu.be/dpw9EHDh2bM\n\n\nHooks let you use state and other React features without writing a class.\n\n\nExample of the useState hook:\n\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Example() {\n  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call \"count\"  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\n        Click me\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nA few snippets from https://softwareontheroad.com/react-hooks/\n\n\n When you work with Reactjs class components you can use state, that’s why these components are also called stateful, also every class component has lifecycle methods like: componentDidMount(), componentDidUpdate(), and so on.\n\nYou can’t use any of this in functional components. Functional components can’t use their own state and don’t have lifecycle methods.\n\nNow with React hooks you can.\n\nReact hooks allows us to take a Reactjs functional component and add state and lifecycle methods to it.\n\nIn simple words, React hooks are special functions to extend the capabilities of functional components and give them the possibility to have lifecycle events and manage state.\n\n\nThe existing React hooks 🍱\n\nThe new API comes with two main pre-existing hooks, and some others for other use cases\nBasics React hooks\n\nThe foundation of all React hooks, every other hook you will see is a variation of these three or are using them as primitives.\n\n    useState is the State hook use it for declaring the state in your components\n    useEffect is the Side effects hook use it for data fetching, manually changing the DOM, and etc.\n    useContext use it in conjunction with Reactjs Context API. When the React Context provider updates, this hook will trigger render with the latest context value.\n\nAdvance React hooks\n\nThese are the most important of the other built-in React hooks that come with the library.\n\n    The useReducer is an alternative to useState, you should use it when you have complex state logic, if you’re familiar with Redux you will like it.\n    The useRef use it for accessing a DOM element with a mutable ref object. Is more useful than the ref attribute\n\n\n\nRules\n\n    Never call Hooks from inside a loop, condition or nested function\n    Never call a Hook from a regular function\n    Only call them inside functions components or custom hooks\n    Hooks should sit at the top level of your component\n    Hooks can call other Hooks\n\n\n\n",

              "Comparing to see if two objects are not really just one referencing the other: Object.is(). This will tell us if one is really just a variable that was passed a reference to the original object, like with: const var1 = obj1; This is only a reference, so Object.is(var1, obj1) will equal true. If so, the values will always be identical.\n\nComparing unique objects can be a little more involved. There is a loose approach and a more strict approach. \n\nWe can test the number of entries in each, as a different number of entries would indicate they are different. We can do this by checking if one has more keys than the other using Object.keys().length or Object.getOwnPropertyNames().length.\nWhen iterating through the objects, we must also account for the possibility of nested arrays and/or objects. These might even go many levels deep.\n\nOne way is to turn both objects into strings using JSON.stringify() and then compare the strings. This will ONLY work if we know the keys will always be IN THE SAME ORDER. When using this method, any variance, like a key being in a different place, will cause the comparison to fail even though the values might be identical.\n\nA more strict approach is to iterate through each object and check the key-value pair against the other. This will work even if the keys are not in the same order. \n\n\nconst user1 = {\n  first: 'Lando',\n  last: 'Calrissian'\n};\nconst user2 = {\n  first: 'Lando',\n  last: 'Calrissian'\n};\n\n\n// Direct comparison\nconsole.log(user1 === user2);  // false\n\n// Stringify process\nconst stringObj1 = JSON.stringify(user1);\nconst stringObj2 = JSON.stringify(user2);\n\nconsole.log(typeof stringObj1);  // string\nconsole.log(stringObj1 === stringObj2);  // true\n\n\n\n// Iterating process possibiltiy\nfunction isSameObject (obj1, obj2) {\n  const props1 = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj1);\n  const props2 = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj2);\n\n  if (props1.length !== props2.length) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < props1.length; i++) {\n    const property = props1[i];\n\n    if (props1[property] !== props2[property]) {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return true;\n}\n\nconsole.log(isSameObject(user1, user2));  // true",

            answer:
              "A pseudo-element in CSS is similar to a pseudo-class in that it uses a keyword added to a selector, but he similarities end there. CSS pseudo-elements let us style a specific part of elements or even add to the beginning or end of the element. In addition, a pseudo-element will use double colons between the keyword and the selector. Technically, because this double-colon convention was not in place early on, the spec still allows this. That said, it is still expected that double colons are used.\n\n\nA few examples:\n\n::after - This creates an inline pseudo-element as the lst child of an element.\n\n::before - Similar to the above, this creates an inline pseudo-element as the first child of an element.\n\n::first-letter - This will apply styles to the first letter of the first line of an element.\n\n::first-line - This works like ::first-letter, but the style will apply to the whole line. What qualifies for the first line will depend on the width of the element, font size and other similar factors.\n\n::selection - When the user highlights a section, usually by clicking and dragging the mouse across text, we can style this highlighted area using the ::selection pseudo-element.\n\n\nDrop this example into an online editor, like https://codepen.io/pen/, to see a few of the pseudo-elements work their magic:\n\nCSS\n\tp::first-letter {\n\t\tfont-size: 50px;\n\t}\n\n\tp::first-line {\n\t\tcolor: orange;\n\t\tletter-spacing: 0.5em;\n\t}\n\n\tp::before {\n\t\tcontent: 'THIS IS BEFORE ---- ';\n\t\tcolor: darkblue;\n\t\tbackground-color: yellowgreen;\n\t}\n\n\tp::after {\n\t\tcontent: '--- THIS IS AFTER';\n\t\tbackground: gray;\n\t\tcolor: aquamarine;\n\t}\n\n\nHTML\n\t<p>The first line will be orange and have letter-spacing applied. The first line changes as the element size changes. The resat of the line will be black, except for the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements. \n\t</p>\n\n",

              "A Promise is basically a placeholder for the results of a request. We can then use handlers based on the eventual success or failure of the request. Promises allow values to be returned much like synchronous methods, just not immediately. In the interim, the Promise, acting as the placeholder, allow the program to move on and will then provide the results of the request whenever they are ready.\n\nA Promise is always either:\n\n    pending: This is the default state. No value is ready nor has anything been rejected.\n    fulfilled: This means the request was completed successfully and the results will be returned.\n    rejected: As it sounds, the operation failed. This will return a reason for the rejection.\n\nA few approaches to handle the results of Promises, we can either chain then() methods with a catch() or use Async/Await. Note: If using Async/Await, it is a good idea to wrap it in a try-catch block to handle a possible rejection.",

            answer:
              'From Wikipedia:\n\nIn computing, tree shaking is a dead code elimination technique that is applied when optimizing code written in ECMAScript dialects like Dart, JavaScript, or TypeScript into a single bundle that is loaded by a web browser. Rather than eliminating code that can never be executed, tree shaking starts from entry point and includes only the code that is guaranteed to be executed.[1] It is succinctly described as "live code inclusion".\nHistory\n\nDead code elimination in dynamic languages is a much harder problem than in static languages. The idea of a "treeshaker" originated in LISP[2] in the 1990s. The idea is that all possible execution flows of a program can be represented as a tree of function calls, so that functions that are never called can be eliminated.\n\nThe algorithm was applied to JavaScript in Google Closure Tools and then to Dart in the dart2js compiler also written by Google, presented by Bob Nystrom in 2012[3][4] and described by the book "Dart in Action" by author Chris Buckett in 2013:\n\n    When code is converted from Dart to JavaScript the compiler does \'tree shaking\'. In JavaScript you have to add an entire library even if you only need it for one function, but thanks to tree shaking the Dart-derived JavaScript only includes the individual functions that you need from a library\n    — Chris Buckett\n\nThe next wave of popularity of the term is attributed to Rich Harris\'s Rollup project[5] developed in 2015.\nRelation to ECMAScript 6 modules\n\nThe popularity of tree shaking in JavaScript is based on the fact that in distinction from CommonJS modules, ECMAScript 6 module loading is static and thus the whole dependency tree can be deduced by statically parsing the syntax tree. Thus tree shaking becomes an easy problem. However, tree shaking does not only apply at the import/export level: it can also work at the statement level, depending on the implementation.[citation needed] ',

              "A clip from:\nhttps://www.katalon.com/resources-center/blog/ci-cd-introduction/\n\n\nCI/CD is the acronym for the combined practices of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). CI/CD practices are currently the most widely accepted choice to shorten software development and delivery cycle time.\n\n\nWhat is Continuous Integration?\n\nIn a CI practice, developers build, run, and test code on their own workstations before committing code to the version control repository. After changes are made to the repository, a chain of events is put into motion. A typical first step in this chain is to build the latest version of source code. If the build is successful, unit tests are executed. If unit testing succeeds, the build is deployed to test environments where system tests are performed (usually using automated tests). The team is notified about the status of this process, and a report is delivered to provide details, such as build number, defects, and the number of tests.\n\n\nWhat is Continuous Delivery?\n\nCD makes it possible to release builds to the production environment when needed. Allowing the team to deploy at will, CD effectively reduces time to market.\n\nBefore deploying software to production, the CD process includes performing automated system testing, unit testing (including API testing and load testing), and integration testing. The steps from CI to CD are usually completed automatically, including automated testing at the unit, integration, and system levels. As tests can fail at any level and environment, CI/CD must include a feedback channel to quickly report failures to developers.",

It is unlikely anyone would speak ill of themselves, but stumbling through or throwing out a bunch of catch phrases like "I am a hard worker" without any detail can be telling. If we take pride in what we do, how we do it and how we treat others, we should be proud enough to talk about it.\n\nUltimately, we just need to give a brief bit of detail about why something about us or our work is good. "I am a hard worker" followed up with how teammates always know, perhaps even commented, that we would get the job done and meet deadlines. Perhaps a bit about how some colleagues have become good friends. Maybe a little highlighting of how a boss liked to throw complicated or new things at us because he or she knew how well we can handle ourselves. This will all, of course, be personal and unique, but the general idea is just to showcase the positive affects that our personality, work ethic and passion have had on the people we worked with and the companies we worked for.\n\n\n',

              'Prior to semantic elements in HTML5, we would use the generic "div" tag and then use more descriptive ID\'s or classes. For example, a navigation menu might be <div id="nav" ></div>. With HTML5, we became able to use a "nav" tag, or "footer" tag and many more. This makes our template more descriptive and easier to follow, which are always goals when working towards clean code.\n\n\nHere are a few of the descriptive tags available:\n\n    <nav></nav>\n\n    <header></header>\n\n    <main>\n        <article></article>\n        <section></section>\n    </main>\n\n    <aside></aside>\n\n    <footer></footer>',

              'This question is sometimes asked because it is more of an intermediate to advanced topic, given that it deals with both how things are layered, how an element\'s parent affects this and how the position property setting can change things.\n\n\tHere are the basics to know:\n\t- z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky).\n\n\t- Elements usually stack with the items that are lower in the DOM appearing on top. z-index can change that for an element using a integer. The higher the number, the higher it goes on the element stack.\n\n\t- Understanding how the parent-child relationship works is very important for understanding how z-index will affect the elements. If element A has children, but element B sits on top of it, then no child element A can ever be higher than element B. No matter how high we make the z-index setting. \n\n\t- You can animate z-index, but it is either behind or in front of an element. It will not transition from one to the other. \n\n\tAn example that can be dropped into an online editor like https://codepen.io/pen/ :\n\n\n\t\tCSS\n\t\t\tdiv {\n\t\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\t\tbackground: black;\n\t\t\tcolor: white;\n\t\t\twidth: 100%;\n\t\t\ttop: 35%;\n\t\t\ttext-align: center;\n\t\t\tpadding: 1em\n\t\t}\n\n\t\timg {\n\t\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\t\tleft: 25%;\n\t\t\ttop: 0;\n\t\t\tz-index: -1;\n\t\t\tmargin: 0 auto;\n\t\t}\n\n\n\t\tHTML\n\t\t    <div><h1>Toggle the image\'s z-index property to watch it go backwards and forwards.</h1>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random" width="50%">\n',

Due to the difficulty in retrofitting CSP into existing websites, CSP is mandatory for all new websites and is strongly recommended for all existing high-risk sites.\n\nThe primary benefit of CSP comes from disabling the use of unsafe inline JavaScript.

[1] A/B tests consist of a randomized experiment with two variants, A and B.[2][3] It includes application of statistical hypothesis testing or "two-sample hypothesis testing" as used in the field of statistics. A/B testing is a way to compare two versions of a single variable, typically by testing a subject\'s response to variant A against variant B, and determining which of the two variants is more effective.[4] \n\n\nHere is a nice excerpt from this article:\nhttps://crossbrowsertesting.com/blog/visual-testing/ab-testing-screenshots/\n\n"One of the more common testing practices that marketers experiment with is A/B testing, which lets you test two scenarios at once to determine which your audience responds to better. This is done by having control and variable scenarios, which are randomly displayed to users when they visit your site.\n\nThese changes can be as small as testing the color of a CTA button to seeing whether adding a video on a landing page will increase registrations. For example, one user may see a green “Sign Up Now” button, while the other sees a red one. During an A/B test, you may look to see which one gets more clicks in order to inform which color you want to set the button to."\n\nA/B testing tools from a list complied in:\nhttps://www.ventureharbour.com/best-a-b-testing-tools/\n\nGoogle Analytics & Google Optimize - Free\nOptimizely\nVWO\nZoho PageSense\nHubSpot\nLeadformly\nUnbounce\nConvertize\nKameleoon\nConvert\n',

            question: "",
            answer:
              'A very complete answer from:\nhttps://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-create-a-multicolor-text-in-html-and-css.html\n\nYou can create a multicolor text with the help of image editors such as Pixelmator, Photoshop and so on. So, you can create a multicolor image and embed it into your website.\nThe multicolor text will not be searchable with this method.\n\nAs a result, your code will look like the following:\n\n<img src="multicolortext.png"/>\n\nMake separate elements¶\n\nAnother way is creating a text with separate elements by using the HTML <span> tag, which is an empty container. This means that you create a multicolor text by putting each letter in a separate element to define a different color for each letter of your text.\nExample of creating a multicolor text with separate elements in HTML:¶\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Title of the document</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <span style="color:#FF0000">H</span>\n    <span style="color:#66CC66">e</span>\n    <span style="color:#FF9966">l</span>\n    <span style="color:#FFCCCC">l</span>\n    <span style="color:#FF0066">o</span>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\nTry it Yourself »\nResult¶\nUse CSS¶\n\nAnd finally, you can use CSS. This is the easiest way of creating such kind of text.\n\nPut your text in a <span> tag and give it a class name "multicolortext". Then, you need the CSS background-image property to add a gradient background to your text with its "linear-gradient" value, where you put the names of your preferred colors.\n\nTo get multicolor text instead of the multicolor background, you need to use the background-clip property, which lets you control how far a background image or color extends beyond the element\'s padding or content. This step gives some colors to your text, but not exactly what you want.\n\nYou can get the final result by making your text color transparent with the color property so that the background color will be reflected in the text.\nExample of creating a multicolor text with HTML and CSS:¶\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>The title of the document</title>\n    <style>\n      .multicolortext {\n        background-image: linear-gradient(to left, violet, indigo, green, blue, yellow, orange, red);\n        -webkit-background-clip: text;\n        -moz-background-clip: text;\n        background-clip: text;\n        color: transparent;\n      }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>\n      <span class="multicolortext">Let’s be creative!</span>\n    </h1>\n  </body>\n</html>',

Adding to this with third-party API's experience, like the Braintree API, or Slack API, can help showcase real-world experience.\n\n\n\nA few options are:\n\t- Geolocations\n\n\t\t        if (navigator.geolocation) {\n\t\t            navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((pos) => {\n\t\t                console.log('Got Location', pos);\n\t\t            }, () => {\n\t\t                console.log('nope')\n\t\t            });\n\t\t        }\n\n\n\n- Media API: This API works for both audio and video. There are a number of methods including play() and pause() as well as load().\n\n- Text Track API: Picking up where the Media API leaves off, the Text Track API allows us to interact with text tracks (subtitles or captions) for the audio and videos.\n\n- Drag and Drop: There are a number of possibilities with this API. Among these, you can add  'draggable' attribute to allow a user to move an element then have event handlers in place on a drop zone so the browser knows where the element can be dropped.\n\n- History API: This spec gives developers more control of the user's browser session. Along with moving the the user forward or backward, we can check the length of the history and even add or remove entries. We can hold data enabling us to restore a page or just update the URL without refreshing the page.\n",

              'Accessibility has become a very big focus for many companies. Knowing they are hiring people that can support this effort is important. The goal for an answer to any question about accessibility is to show that we have a basic understanding combined with being able to about real-world use.\n\nAccessibility is no longer just something nice to incorporate, it is essential for making sure people, best practices and, in some cases, laws are being respected. \n\nA few accessibility features we can incorporate:\n\nThoughtful contrasting colors for people who have trouble seeing color. This allows them to see a difference between two colored areas.\n\nAria labels are important for signalling correct detail to screen readers.\n\nUsing tags instead of CSS properties, like <em> instead of font-weight, will signal to screen-readers the intent to emphasis. This can then be past along to the user.\nThere are tools available, like Lighthouse now included in Chrome Dev Tools, that can run scans and alert us to accessibility concerns.\n\n\nHere is an example of the <em> and an aria label:\n\n\n    <p>Hi my name is Sheev Palpatine, but you can call me <em>EMPORER DARTH SIDIOUS</em></p>\n\n    <button aria-label="Close Modal">Close</button>',

HTTP2 adds a number of features to manage the streams, but leaves old semantics untouched.\n\n\nHTTP/2 supports queries multiplexing, headers compression, priority and more intelligent packet streaming management.

We just need to give a brief reasoning that includes our thoughts surrounding big moves, our steps to work with our current employer before making th e moves and how those decisions ended up being good or, perhaps, lessons that we learned from those that did not.\n\nUltimately, we don't want to lie or give the impression we are trying to cover anything up. There are always reasons and many of them are good reasons. Taking advantage of opportunities for personal or professional advancement are definitely good reasons. On the other side, some reasons are lessons that are part of our growth.\n",

            answer:
              "This question is designed to see our thought process on this issue.\n\nHere are some basic steps for approaching a slow app:\n\n\t1. Define the specific problem. What, specifically is slow? Is the initial load slow? Are page transitions slow? Do the interactions, like menu animations, seem slow or choppy? Does this occur on only some browsers or devices? \n\n\t\tUltimately, the goal here is to get as clear a picture as possible as of each part that is slow. This enables us to find the best spots to begin drilling down.\n\n\t2. Narrow the scope: Next we want to take our drill-down points and begin to narrow each of those to as small a piece of code as we can. \n\n\t\tFor instance, if the issue is slow loading, a good place to start is either Chrome Dev Tools' Lighthouse tool or a page speed analyzer. One popular one is: \n\n\t\thttps://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/\n\n\t\tThese tools can help see where it is slow, like the first paint or how long until a user can actually interact with the page. From there it can help us pinpoint potential problem areas, like large images or slow server response.\n\n\t\tin a browser's dev tools we can use other tools, like the Network section to see detail on specific items like when they loaded, how long they took and if they were blocking progress. \n\n\t\tIf the issue is something not related to resources loading, dev tools can help narrow down the search using the Debugger, Performance, Inspector, Console and others. \n\n\t3. Isolate: Once we gained an understanding of the specific symptoms and then narrowed the scope of our attention, we can now address these specific areas of code. Dev tools Debugger can be great for stepping through JavaScript. The Performance tool can help see how an animation affects the page processing. \n\n\t\tIf need be, it can help to isolate specific blocks of code in a separate editor, perhaps even an online editor like repl.it, codepen.io or jsbin.com. This can help zero-in on specific problems in the code.\n\t\tAlong the same line of thinking, commenting out blocks of code and/or temporarily inserting new simplified code can help ensure we have properly identified the problem area.\n\n\t4. Fix: By this point, we have arrived at the problem pieces of code. Now, we just need to correct the issue.\n\n\t5. Test...a lot: We have not fixed the problem at this point. We have only written the code that we think will correct the issue. Test. Test. Test then take a break...test again. At that point, we have fixed teh issue.",

              'There are a wide array of strategies for this answer. Below are a few basic approaches, though a web search (click the "More About this Question" button for that) will yield a wealth of detail and other options.\n\n- We can just give an amount we would like to make and we think we are worth. it is simple and direct, though it might be a factor in eliminating us from the candidate list if the number far exceeds what the company wants to spend on the position or thinks we are worth. This approach is not concerned with staying in market value. It is more about weeding out companies that can not or do not wish to pay what we value our services at. \n\n- We can take our current salary and just raise that a little. Assuming we are applying for a similar position, or even slightly elevated, this keeps us around market range. \n\n- If the job is meant to be an entry into a new career, pushing for more money might hurt the greater purpose. We might want to consider looking for the salary range listed in the job post and speaking to an amount towards the middle, with a minimum around the listed minimum. Or, perhaps, if our situation is one where little more or less would not matter and getting in the door is the focus, being honest about this can be OK. It would be best to also ask how soon someone is eligible for a raise and to make sure they do not offer below their posted minimum. There are some who would say never ask for or imply the offered minimum, but getting the first foot in can make a tremendous difference and then enable us to make the next interview about what we are really worth.\n\n- Use online tools to find a market salary range and then ask for a salary somewhere between the average and the top salary depending on where our skills and experience put us.\n\n\n\tA few tools for finding market value:\n\n\t\tGlassDoor: https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/index.htm\n\t\tPayScale: https://www.payscale.com/my/survey/choose\n\t\tLinkedin Salary Tool: https://www.linkedin.com/salary/',

              'This answer comes from:\nhttps://resource-centre.net/html5-tutorials/bullet-point-lists/\n\nBullet Point Lists (or Unordered Lists)\n\nThe first kind of list we will look at is using bullets.\nUnordered List – the <ul> Tag\n\nBullet point lists are also known as unordered lists (UL) because there is no numbering involved. That is why a bulleted list uses the <ul> </ul> tag pair. Here is a basic example:\n\nThe whole list is surrounded by <ul> </ul> for a start. When you open your list tag, make sure you automatically type your closing tag and then proceed to fill your items between them.\nThe type Attribute\n\nThe type attribute determines what kind of bullet you are seeing on the page. Although through CSS you can specify a wide-range of bullet styles, and even use your own image, in raw HTML it is best to stick with the common types which are\n\n    type="circle" – an unfilled circle\n\n    type="disc" – a filled circle\n\n    type="square" – a filled square\n\nList Items – the <li> Tag\n\nEach individual item in your list is wrapped in its own <li> </li> tag pair. You can often get away without the </li> but I would recommend keeping it in, just so you maintain healthy coding habit.\n\nThe list above I placed in individual <ul> but each <li> also supports the type attribute, such that I could create\n\n    Square\n    Disc\n    Circle\n\nNot sure why you would want to do that, but you can if you want to!\n\nBullet List Indentation\n\nBefore you apply any CSS to your list, HTML (or more accurately, your browser) will apply indentation to your list, so it stands out from your normal paragraph <p> tags.\nOrdered / Numbered Lists – the <ol> Tag\n\nIf you want to present your list in an ordered fashion, then the <ol> tag is your friend. By default this will give you a numbered list, but the type attribute gives you flexibility, in the same way as bullet point lists do.\n\nwhich outputs\n\n    Item 1\n    Item 2\n    Item 3\n\nThe type attribute offers a few more options in ordered lists compared to bulleted ones. A bit more guidance on this can be obtained at W3Schools.\nStarting an Ordered List On A Different Number\n\nSay you were putting together some instructions to build a table. You may want to use a numbered list to achieve this. However, if you wanted to put images and extra text between each stage, you would probably need multiple lists. The problem is that each list starts at number 1 (or letter A) by default. That would screw up your instructions!\n\nThankfully HTML has the start property to allow you to start on a subsequent number:\n\nThis outputs:\n\n    Step Four\n    Step Five\n    Step Six\n\nReversing The Order\n\nIf you want to show your numbers (or letters) in reverse order, then this is really easy too. You might want to do a ‘Top 10’ with your best item announced last, for example. This can be done by adding the word reversed into your Ordered List opening tag:\n\nAnd this would make your list look like this:\n\n    First LI\n    Second LI\n    Third LI\n    Fourth LI\n    Fifth LI\n\nMulti-Level Bullet List in HTML\n\nWith patchy browser support (and sometimes undone by CSS in some sites) you can create a multilevel list. This is achieved by embedding one list inside another:\n\nWhich creates:\n\n    Top Level Item\n        Sub-Item 1\n        Sub-Item 2\n    Top Level Item\n\nYou can use a combination of <ul> and <ol>. That may be useful if you want bullet points under a numbered list.\n\n    Top Level Item\n        Sub-Item 1\n        Sub-Item 2\n    Top Level Item\n',

In either case, we need to work into the interview an example or two that showcases our ability to work with others. Overall, we want to exhibit good communication skills, and a brief bit about how important we think communication skills are when working with teams, or our superiors, the client, etc can help. Perhaps even a story about a time when kept our calm when others did not, or an example of how we set aside things that bothered us, and were able to generate harmony that helped move a project forward. All of this needs to be delivered, like all of our answers, with good eye contact without staring, enthusiasm married with a calm and thoughtful approach and general good will and respectful manner. These qualities can mean a lot to a company and can raise our profile above others in the eyes of the interviewer.\n",

              'The following excerpt come from bitofco.de:\nhttps://bitsofco.de/understanding-the-virtual-dom/\n\nWhy do we need a virtual DOM?\n\nTo understand why the concept of the virtual DOM arose, let’s revisit the original DOM. As I mentioned, there are two parts to the DOM - the object-based representation of the HTML document and the API to manipulating that object.\n\nFor example, let’s take this simple HTML document with an unordered list and one list item.\n\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang="en">\n <head></head>\n <body>\n    <ul class="list">\n        <li class="list__item">List item</li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\n\nThis document can be represented as the following DOM tree:\n\nhtml\nhead lang="en"\nbody\nul class="list"\nli class="list__item"\n"List item"\n\nLet’s say we want to modify the content of the first list item to \n"List item one"\n and also add a second list item. To do this, we will need use the DOM APIs to find the elements we want to update, create the new elements, add attributes and content, then finally update the DOM elements themselves.\n\nconst listItemOne = document.getElementsByClassName("list__item")[0];\nlistItemOne.textContent = "List item one";\n\nconst list = document.getElementsByClassName("list")[0];\nconst listItemTwo = document.createElement("li");\nlistItemTwo.classList.add("list__item");\nlistItemTwo.textContent = "List item two";\nlist.appendChild(listItemTwo);\n\nThe DOM wasn’t made for this…\n\nWhen the first specification for the DOM was released in 1998, we built and managed web pages in very differently. There was far less reliance on the DOM APIs to create and update the page content as frequently as we do today.\n\nSimple methods such as \ndocument.getElementsByClassName()\n are fine to use on a small scale, but if we are updating multiple elements on a page every few seconds, it can start to become really expensive to constantly query and update the DOM.\n\nEven further, because of the way the APIs are setup, it is usually simpler to perform more expensive operations where we update larger parts of the document than to find and update the specific elements. Going back to our list example, it is in some ways easier to replace the entire unordered list with a new one than to modify the specific elements.\n\nconst list = document.getElementsByClassName("list")[0];\nlist.innerHTML = `\n<li class="list__item">List item one</li>\n<li class="list__item">List item two</li>\n`;\n\n\nIn this particular example, the performance difference between the methods is probably insignificant. However, as the size of the web page grows, it becomes more important to only select and update what is needed.\n\n… but the virtual DOM was!\n\nThe virtual DOM was created to solve these problems of needing to frequently update the DOM in a more performant way. Unlike the DOM or the shadow DOM, the virtual DOM isn\'t an official specification, but rather a new method of interfacing with the DOM.\n\nA virtual DOM can be thought of as a copy of the original DOM. This copy can be frequently manipulated and updated, without using the DOM APIs. Once all the updates have been made to the virtual DOM, we can look at what specific changes need to be made to the original DOM and make them in a targetted and optimised way.',

Our goal is to show that we not only have dealt with conflict but that we have thought about it and worked through the difficult aspects. The worst thing we can do is not have an answer, or say we have never encountered any conflict. That is not realistic and it leaves the question wide open as to what they can expect from us if we encounter conflict while working there. Even a story about how we handled conflict poorly is fine, as long as we can talk clearly about how we thought and felt at the time and how we eventually learned how to handle it all better. \n\nTo put it simply:\n\tBe human. \n\tShow growth. \n\tShow thought. \n\tShow intent to understand others, even if they are acting poorly. \n\tShow a desire to explore the finer points of human interaction.\n\tShow that all of the above maters enough to have carefully thought about it.\n",

Led by Web inventor and Director Tim Berners-Lee and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe, W3C\'s mission is to lead the Web to its full potential.\n\n\nWhat does W3C do?\n\nW3C\'s primary activity is to develop protocols and guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the Web. W3C\'s standards define key parts of what makes the World Wide Web work. Learn more about W3C\'s mission.\nWhere is W3C located?\n\nW3C does not have a single physical headquarters. There are four institutions, however, that "host" W3C: MIT (in Cambridge, MA, USA), ERCIM (in Sophia-Antipolis, France), Keio University (near Tokyo, Japan), and Beihang University (in Beijing, China).\n\nThe W3C staff is distributed around the world, but there are concentrations of people in Cambridge, Massachusetts (USA), Sophia-Antipolis (France), and Tokyo (Japan). In addition, W3C is represented in 17 other regions of the world via representatives based at organizations. W3C calls these regional points of contact "W3C Offices."\nHow is W3C funded?\n\nW3C receives funds from:\n\n    W3C Member dues\n    Research grants and other sources of private and public funding\n    Individual donations of money and equipment \n\nWhat is the difference between the Web and the Internet?\n\nFrom the definition in the Wikipedia: "The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that interchange data by packet switching using the standardized Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)."\n\nThus, the Internet is a network of networks, defined by the TPC/IP standards.\n\nThe Web, on the other hand, is defined in W3C\'s Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume I as follows: "The World Wide Web (WWW, or simply Web) is an information space in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI)."\n\nThus, the Web is an information space.

              "Load balancing is simple technique for distributing workloads across multiple machines or clusters. The most common and simple load balancing algorithm is Round Robin. In this type of load balancing the request is divided in circular order ensuring all machines get equal number of requests and no single machine is overloaded or underloaded.\n\nThe Purpose of load balancing is to\n\nOptimize resource usage (avoid overload and under-load of any machines)\nAchieve Maximum Throughput\nMinimize response time\nMost common load balancing techniques in web based applications are\n\nRound robin\nSession affinity or sticky session\nIP Address affinity",

              "What is async, defer, preload and prefetch for loading JavaScript documents",
            answer:
              'All of this addresses the loading of documents and how they affect the main document.\n\nFrom:https://javascript.info/script-async-defer\n\n\nDEFER:\n\nThe defer attribute tells the browser not to wait for \nthe script. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, \nbuild DOM. The script loads “in the background”, and then runs when the \nDOM is fully built.\n\nHere’s the same example with defer:\n<p>...content before script...</p>\n\n<scrip/t defer src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js?speed=1"></scrip/t>\n\n<!-- visible immediately -->\n<p>...content after script...</p>\n\n\nIn other words:\n\n    - Scripts with defer never block the page.\n    - Scripts with defer always execute when the DOM is ready (but before DOMContentLoaded event).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASYNC\n\nThe async attribute is somewhat like \ndefer. It also makes the script non-blocking. But it has important differences in the behavior.\n\nThe async attribute means that a script is completely independent:\n\n    - The browser doesn’t block on async scripts (like defer).\n    - Other scripts don’t wait for async scripts, and async scripts don’t wait for them.\n    - DOMContentLoaded and async scripts don’t wait for each other:\n        | DOMContentLoaded may happen both before an async script (if an async script finishes loading after the page is complete)\n        | …or after an async script (if an async script is short or was in HTTP-cache)\n\n    <p>...content before scripts...</p>\n\n    <scrip/t>\n      document.addEventListener(\'DOMContentLoaded\', () => alert("DOM ready!"));\n    </scrip/t>\n\n    <scrip/t async src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js"></scrip/t>\n    <scrip/t async src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/small.js"></scrip/t>\n\n    <p>...content after scripts...</p>\n\n\n\nThe following examples come from: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/html-preload-prefetch\n\n\n    \nPRELOAD\n\nPreloading JavaScript resources is done differently. This example, taken from this Google Developers article on preloading, shows this:\nindex.html\n\n<link rel="preload" href="used-later.js" as="scrip/t">\n<!-- ... -->\n<scrip/t>\n  var usedLaterScript = document.createElement(\'script\');\n  usedLaterScript.src = \'used-later.js\';\n  document.body.appendChild(usedLaterScript);\n</scrip/t>\n\n\n\nPREFETCH\n\nPrefetching works similarly to preloading. The difference is that, \nwhen prefetching a resource, the browser considers the resource to be \nlow priority. This means that the resource or asset will load a bit \nlater. Because of this, prefetching is usually implemented with \nresources that are not required initially, but are used at a later \npoint.\n\nTo implement prefectching in your HTML page, change the value of \nrel to "prefetching.\n\nindex.html\n<link\n  rel="prefetch"\n  as="style"\n  onload="this.rel = \'stylesheet\'"\n  href=\'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:100,900|Material+Icons\'>\n',

              'This is generally asked to get an idea of how much someone pays attention to good practices and, ultimately, will write easier to understand code and have an easier time jumping into someone else\'s code.\n\nGeneral naming conventions:\n-\tNames should be brief, but descriptive enough that the average non-developer could understand. For example, using "d = new Date()" might serve brevity, but can make no sense later in the program and require extra effort to understand. Conversely, "theDateForTheDayTheAppIsRun = new Date()" is clear, but unnecessarily long. Simply "todaysDate = new Date()" is brief and easily understood.\n\nA few JavaScript examples can be:\n- Camel case for variables: const lastName = \'Kenobi\'\n- Pascal case for classes: class MainCharacter { }\n- "is" or "has" prefix for booleans.\n- Function calls that will be returning something can start with have a descriptive verb ("update", "get", etc).\n- As few variables as possible. This is not really a naming convention, but it greatly affects the abilty for the names of the variables that do get used to be easier to follow and keep track of.\n- Do not re-use variable names.\n- In many cases it is better not to make a variable equal itself with modification. This can be difficult to follow through and can often be better served with a new, variable descriptively named to match the newly formed data.\n- When reasonable, if a specific item in an array is being used, assign a more descriptive variable: const updatedFileId = changes[0]\n- Property names that do not need to be prefixed with the class name. \n\tWe do not need: class Car {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructor(brand, purchaseDate) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.carName = brand;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.carYear = purchaseDate;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n} \n\tInstead, we can use: class Car {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructor(brand) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.name = brand;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.year = purchaseDate;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t} \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t// in use it will still be descriptive\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconst myCar = new Car();\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmyCar,name = \'Jeep\';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmyCar.year = \'2017\';\n- Avoid "magic" numbers, or numbers without a name, when possible. \n\tWe want to avoid: const forwardMovement = duration * 3;\n\tWe can use: const rate = 3;\n\t\t\t\t  forwardMovement = duration * rate;\n\t\t\t\t \n\nCSS & HTML examples:\n- Use nicely cascading rules to make for as few selectors as possible.\n- Kabab case for selectors: .inner-wrap\n- Descriptive selector names. This can be the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) method or similar.\n- Try to avoid using the same name for an ID and a class. These are technically independent from each other, but this can cause confusion for a developer.\n',

This is often not ideal, as we are generally better off knowing how many parameters we will be passing, but for the occasions where we do not, the Rest operator makes for a clean, readable and powerful tool.\n\n\nfunction sum(...theArgs) {\n  let total = 0;\n  for (const arg of theArgs) {\n    total += arg;\n  }\n  return total;\n}\n\nconsole.log(sum(1, 2, 3));\n// Expected output: 6\n\nconsole.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4));\n// Expected output: 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spread (...) syntax allows an iterable, such as an array or string, to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected. In an object literal, the spread syntax enumerates the properties of an object and adds the key-value pairs to the object being created.\n\nSpread syntax looks exactly like rest syntax. In a way, spread syntax is the opposite of rest syntax. Spread syntax "expands" an array into its elements, while rest syntax collects multiple elements and "condenses" them into a single element. See rest parameters and rest property.\n\nfunction sum(x, y, z) {\n\n  return x + y + z;\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3];\n\n\n\n\nconsole.log(sum(...numbers));\n\n// Expected output: 6\n\n\n\n\nconsole.log(sum.apply(null, numbers));\n\n// Expected output: 6\n\n\n',

              'This might sound like a silly question, but questions like this sometimes are used to get us to show our understanding of basic, but often needed, aspects of CSS. This will usually be a screening question, so a descriptive verbal outline will needed, not actual code.\n\nTo begin, we need to target our element via ID, or by class for multiple elements. We then want to set an equal width and height, perhaps 100px each. From there, we can either set the border for a few pixels or a background color or even both. This way we can see it. At that point, we have a square.\n\nMaking that square a circle simply requires a border-radius of 50% all of the way around. \n\nNow, that is a fixed width square or circle. We could make it responsive by using a percentage as the width and an equal percentage as padding-bottom. If there is content in the square or circle, one way to keep the sides equal would be to absolutely position the content. Ultimately, this is just an option. There are many ways to approach graphics in CSS, and purpose and the rest of the document will play into a plan for making the graphics responsive.\n\n\nPaste this example into an online editor, like https://codepen.io/pen/, to see the square and circle:\n\n\tCSS\n\t\t.square {\n\t\t\tbackground: lightgreen;\n\t\t\twidth: 50%;\n\t\t\tpadding-bottom: 50%;\n\t\t\tmargin: 0 auto;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t.square.circle {\n\t\t\tborder-radius: 50%;\n\t\t\tbackground: salmon;\n\t\t}\n\n\tHTML\n\t\t<div class="square"></div>\n\n\t\t<div class="square circle"></div>',

              "The days of great consideration being paid to Internet Explorer's many differences will, or possibly have, come to an end. This does not mean browser compatibility is no longer a concern. \nModern browsers are much more consistent with including features, but it is still good to check with a tool like https://caniuse.com/ or MDN to make sure new features are well covered.\n\nFor most browsers, we can easily download them and test our app. But what about older versions of each browser? What about these browsers on different devices. What if we need to test on Safari, but do not have access to a Mac? There are tools like https://www.browserstack.com/ to test web apps in many different ways. Some will even monitor real users on different browsers and devices. We can even have automated routines to test these scenarios.  \n\nBeyond testing, it is important that we know well what our target audience is going to be. If it is truly a global reach we are seeking, we need to consider things like Opera Mini (popular in parts of the world with slow internet), Baidu (a popular China-based browser), KaiOS' browser (mobile OS and browser used all over and especially in India) and any others that are used.\n\nAll of this does not mean that wide-reach intentions mean we need to remove most of our JavaScript just to make the app work right on Opera Mini. It just means just that we need to consider what happens to our product for the those users and work towards good solutions. \n\nWhithin any app, we should pay attention to current browser compatibility and utilize thinking along these lines:\n\n\t- We might just need to ensure there are fullbacks in place.\n\n\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\tposition: sticky; // Not fully supported by some browsers\n\n\t- We can plan our interactions and layouts so that nothing critical relies on technology not fully supported.\t\n\n\t- We can check for specific feature support in a browser and have separate functionality ready. This is not ideal as it requires extra consideration when maintaining the web app, but it is a workable solution.\n\n\t- We and the customer can consider the costs vs the gains related to supporting certain browsers. The benefits might not offset the costs of supporting a specific browser's use and/or the areas of the world it is popular.",

              'Some browsers accept additional proprietary non-standard non-css syntax on top of the usual css. Less is build on top of standard css and therefore may not recognize it. You may also need to put an otherwise non-parseable value inside a variable and use it to dynamically build selector or other css part during compilation time.\n\nEscaping allows you to use any arbitrary string as property or variable value. It can be used also to dynamically build selectors, but that feature is deprecated and replaced by different more powerful option.\n\nSyntax\n\nUse either ~"whatever" or ~\'whatever\' syntax to escape property values. Anything between quotes is used as is with almost no changes. The "as is" rule has one exception: string interpolation works with the usual @{variableName} syntax.\n\nUsed as Property Value\n\nSample input:\n\n@variable: "dynamic";\nh1 {\n  margin: 1 ~"2 2" 3;\n  padding: ~\'ms:special.syntax()\';\n  text: ~\'@{variable}\'; //interpolation works\n}\n\ncompiles into:\n\nh1 {\n  margin: 1 2 2 3;\n  padding: ms:special.syntax();\n  text: dynamic;\n}\n\n',

              "Excerpts from hacker.io:\n\nCSS was originally released in 1996 and consists of properties for adding font properties such as typeface and emphasis color of text, backgrounds, and other elements. CSS2 was released in 1998 with added styles for other media types so that it can be used for page layout designing. CSS3 was released in 1999 and presentation-style properties were added in it that allows you to build a presentation from documents.\n\nUnlike CSS2, which was comprised of a single document, CSS3 has its specifications divided into many individual modules, which makes CSS3 a whole lot easier to handle.\n\nWith CSS3, the designers can now use special fonts, like those available in Google Fonts and Typecast. Earlier, with CSS and CSS2, designers could only use “web-safe fonts” for being 100% sure to use fonts that would always display the same on every machine.\n\nWhile CSS and CSS2 had ‘simple selectors’, CSS3 calls the components as ‘a sequence of simple selectors’.\n\nCSS3 came up with some key web design considerations like rounded borders that help in rounding up the borders without any hassle. This turned out to be a huge plus point for developers who were struggling with initial versions of CSS borders.\n\nCSS3 has the capability to split text sections into multiple columns so that it can be read like a newspaper. In CSS2, the developers had difficulty because the standard was not equipped with automatically breaking the text so that it fits within a box.\n\n",

            answer:
              'Synchronous code runs from top to bottom in order. One line, command, function, etc is processed and resolved before moving to the next. This can be problematic if you encounter "blocking" code, which is code that causes processing one item for a longer amount of time. This means the rest of the program (and end user) wait until the program can mover on to the next line. This is where asynchronous code can be helpful.\n\nAsynchronous code runs separately from other code. This means it can take longer to process without "blocking" the rest of the program from running. In JavaScript, the Call Stack processes code synchronously. If a piece of asynchronous code is encountered, it is moved out of the Call Stack. If it is part of a Web API, like setTimeOut(), then the browser handles the resolving the code. Otherwise, it is moved to the Callback Que. In either case, the Event Loop will take the next item that has resolved, and place it on the Call Stack. This time, when the code can be dealt with in order because it is ready and will not block the processing the rest of the program.',

            level: "basic",
            answer:
              "Closure is an inner function, that is accessible outside of its parent function's scope while maintaining its connection to the parent's variables and other data. This can be don to keep some data private and purposely expose other data.\nTo accomplish this, an anonymous function can be immediately invoked. In this function, data we wish to keep  private can be processed. Usually this data would be removed from memory via JavaScript's \"garbage collection\" memory clearing process. If this function returns a function, let's call it a child function, that accesses data from the parent function, the parent's data will remain in memory. In this situation, the only access to the parent function's data will be via whatever had been set up in the child function. In addition, every time the child function is invoked, a new function scope is created for the child function. The parent function scope is only created once. This means that we can invoke the child function to change a variable in the parent and the next time we invoke the child function the variable in the parent will still reflect the change. \n\nThis can be considered state management and might not be as useful today given other options to manage state. Still, this process can be used to protect sensitive data or even just a to keep a counter variable from being accidentally increased.\n\nSome examples\n// For comparison, this is a counter without closure\nlet counter = 0;\n\nfunction add1 () {\n\tcounter++;\n\treturn counter;\n}\n\nconsole.log(add1());  // 1\nconsole.log(add1());  // 2\n// The counter becomes unpredictable when it can be altered elswhere\ncounter++;\nconsole.log(add1());  // 4\n\n\n// This is a counter with closure\nconst add1 = (function () {\n  let counter = 0;\n\n  return function () {\n\tcounter++;\n\treturn counter;\n  };\n})();\nconsole.log(add1());  // 1\nconsole.log(add1());  // 2\nconsole.log(add1());  // 3\ncounter++;// error: counter is not defined\nconsole.log(add1());\n\n// Another, more complex example\n// In this travelAgent() in the child function made available, while \n// the \"trip\" variable and agent() function are accessible through \n// travelAgent(). The book() function, is only accessible through agent().\nfunction vacation() {\n\tvar trip;\n\n\tfunction travelAgent(itinerary) {\n\t\tagent(itinerary);\n\t\treturn trip;\n\t}\n\n\tfunction agent(itinerary) {\n\t\tif (itinerary === 'Orlando') {\n\t\t\ttrip = ['Orlando', 'Disney', 'Universal'];\n\t\t\tbook();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tfunction book() {\n\t\ttrip.push('booked');\n\t}\n\treturn travelAgent;\n}\n\nvar myVacation = vacation();\n\nconsole.log(myVacation('Orlando'));\n\n// Array [ \"Orlando\", \"Disney\", \"Universal\", \"booked\" ]\n",

A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.\n\nO - Open-closed principle. Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.\n\nL - Liskov substitution principle. Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.\n\nI - Interface segregation principle. A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.\n\nD - Dependency Inversion Principle. Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.\n\nHere is a good article on the subject: https://dev.to/francescoxx/solid-principles-in-javascript-3pek\n",

The attack is possible thanks to HTML frames (iframes).\n\nIts other name, user interface (UI) redressing, better describes what is going on. Users think they are using a web page’s normal UI, but in fact there is a hidden UI in control; in other words, the UI has been redressed.

So, it is easy for designers and developers to work more efficiently and quickly.\n    It is compatible with all versions of CSS. So, you can use any available CSS libraries.\n    It provides nesting so you can use nested syntax and useful functions like color manipulation, math functions and other values.\n\nDisadvantages\n\n    The developer must have enough time to learn new features present in this preprocessor before using it.\n    Using Sass may result in the loss of some benefits of a browser's built-in element inspector.",

              "This addresses what happens when passing data from one variable to another. More specifically, this is about where variables point. \n\nThe original variable points to a place in memory. The new variable can either point to the same place in memory, which means the reference to the data was passed, or the new variable can point to a new place in memory that contains the same data, which means the values were passed to the new memory location.\n\nThe main reason this is important is shown by the results of changing either variable. If only a reference was passed, meaning both variables point to the same data at the same memory location, then changing a value will change change it for both variables, as well as any others pointing to the same place in memory.\n\nIf the actual values were passed and reside at a new location in memory, changing the values at the new memory location will only be visible with the new variable (and any others pointing to that location). The original variable is still pointing at the old memory location and remains unchanged.\n\nExamples:\nlet example1 = 1;\nlet example2 = example1;\nexample2++;\n\nconsole.log(example1, ' - ', example2);\n\nconst example3 = {\n  weapon: 'lightsaber'\n};\nconst example4 = {\n  ...example3\n};\nexample4.name = 'Darth Vader';\nconsole.log(example3, ' - ', example4);",

It is positioned relative to the initial containing block established by the viewport, except when one of its ancestors has a transform, perspective, or filter property set to something other than none (see the CSS Transforms Spec), in which case that ancestor behaves as the containing block. (Note that there are browser inconsistencies with perspective and filter contributing to containing block formation.)

The offset does not affect the position of any other elements. \n\nThis value always creates a new stacking context. Note that a sticky element "sticks" to its nearest ancestor that has a "scrolling mechanism" (created when overflow is hidden, scroll, auto, or overlay), even if that ancestor isn\'t the nearest actually scrolling ancestor.

              "Here is a video introduction to hooks:\nhttps://youtu.be/dpw9EHDh2bM\n\n\nHooks let you use state and other React features without writing a class.\n\n\nExample of the useState hook:\n\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Example() {\n  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call \"count\"  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\n        Click me\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nA few snippets from https://softwareontheroad.com/react-hooks/\n\n\n When you work with Reactjs class components you can use state, that’s why these components are also called stateful, also every class component has lifecycle methods like: componentDidMount(), componentDidUpdate(), and so on.\n\nYou can’t use any of this in functional components. Functional components can’t use their own state and don’t have lifecycle methods.\n\nNow with React hooks you can.\n\nReact hooks allows us to take a Reactjs functional component and add state and lifecycle methods to it.\n\nIn simple words, React hooks are special functions to extend the capabilities of functional components and give them the possibility to have lifecycle events and manage state.\n\n\nThe existing React hooks 🍱\n\nThe new API comes with two main pre-existing hooks, and some others for other use cases\nBasics React hooks\n\nThe foundation of all React hooks, every other hook you will see is a variation of these three or are using them as primitives.\n\n    useState is the State hook use it for declaring the state in your components\n    useEffect is the Side effects hook use it for data fetching, manually changing the DOM, and etc.\n    useContext use it in conjunction with Reactjs Context API. When the React Context provider updates, this hook will trigger render with the latest context value.\n\nAdvance React hooks\n\nThese are the most important of the other built-in React hooks that come with the library.\n\n    The useReducer is an alternative to useState, you should use it when you have complex state logic, if you’re familiar with Redux you will like it.\n    The useRef use it for accessing a DOM element with a mutable ref object. Is more useful than the ref attribute\n\n\n\nRules\n\n    Never call Hooks from inside a loop, condition or nested function\n    Never call a Hook from a regular function\n    Only call them inside functions components or custom hooks\n    Hooks should sit at the top level of your component\n    Hooks can call other Hooks\n\n\n\n",

              "Comparing to see if two objects are not really just one referencing the other: Object.is(). This will tell us if one is really just a variable that was passed a reference to the original object, like with: const var1 = obj1; This is only a reference, so Object.is(var1, obj1) will equal true. If so, the values will always be identical.\n\nComparing unique objects can be a little more involved. There is a loose approach and a more strict approach. \n\nWe can test the number of entries in each, as a different number of entries would indicate they are different. We can do this by checking if one has more keys than the other using Object.keys().length or Object.getOwnPropertyNames().length.\nWhen iterating through the objects, we must also account for the possibility of nested arrays and/or objects. These might even go many levels deep.\n\nOne way is to turn both objects into strings using JSON.stringify() and then compare the strings. This will ONLY work if we know the keys will always be IN THE SAME ORDER. When using this method, any variance, like a key being in a different place, will cause the comparison to fail even though the values might be identical.\n\nA more strict approach is to iterate through each object and check the key-value pair against the other. This will work even if the keys are not in the same order. \n\n\nconst user1 = {\n  first: 'Lando',\n  last: 'Calrissian'\n};\nconst user2 = {\n  first: 'Lando',\n  last: 'Calrissian'\n};\n\n\n// Direct comparison\nconsole.log(user1 === user2);  // false\n\n// Stringify process\nconst stringObj1 = JSON.stringify(user1);\nconst stringObj2 = JSON.stringify(user2);\n\nconsole.log(typeof stringObj1);  // string\nconsole.log(stringObj1 === stringObj2);  // true\n\n\n\n// Iterating process possibiltiy\nfunction isSameObject (obj1, obj2) {\n  const props1 = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj1);\n  const props2 = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj2);\n\n  if (props1.length !== props2.length) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < props1.length; i++) {\n    const property = props1[i];\n\n    if (props1[property] !== props2[property]) {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return true;\n}\n\nconsole.log(isSameObject(user1, user2));  // true",

            answer:
              "A pseudo-element in CSS is similar to a pseudo-class in that it uses a keyword added to a selector, but he similarities end there. CSS pseudo-elements let us style a specific part of elements or even add to the beginning or end of the element. In addition, a pseudo-element will use double colons between the keyword and the selector. Technically, because this double-colon convention was not in place early on, the spec still allows this. That said, it is still expected that double colons are used.\n\n\nA few examples:\n\n::after - This creates an inline pseudo-element as the lst child of an element.\n\n::before - Similar to the above, this creates an inline pseudo-element as the first child of an element.\n\n::first-letter - This will apply styles to the first letter of the first line of an element.\n\n::first-line - This works like ::first-letter, but the style will apply to the whole line. What qualifies for the first line will depend on the width of the element, font size and other similar factors.\n\n::selection - When the user highlights a section, usually by clicking and dragging the mouse across text, we can style this highlighted area using the ::selection pseudo-element.\n\n\nDrop this example into an online editor, like https://codepen.io/pen/, to see a few of the pseudo-elements work their magic:\n\nCSS\n\tp::first-letter {\n\t\tfont-size: 50px;\n\t}\n\n\tp::first-line {\n\t\tcolor: orange;\n\t\tletter-spacing: 0.5em;\n\t}\n\n\tp::before {\n\t\tcontent: 'THIS IS BEFORE ---- ';\n\t\tcolor: darkblue;\n\t\tbackground-color: yellowgreen;\n\t}\n\n\tp::after {\n\t\tcontent: '--- THIS IS AFTER';\n\t\tbackground: gray;\n\t\tcolor: aquamarine;\n\t}\n\n\nHTML\n\t<p>The first line will be orange and have letter-spacing applied. The first line changes as the element size changes. The resat of the line will be black, except for the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements. \n\t</p>\n\n",

            answer:
              "A Promise is basically a placeholder for the results of a request. We can then use handlers based on the eventual success or failure of the request. Promises allow values to be returned much like synchronous methods, just not immediately. In the interim, the Promise, acting as the placeholder, allow the program to move on and will then provide the results of the request whenever they are ready.\n\nA Promise is always either:\n\n    pending: This is the default state. No value is ready nor has anything been rejected.\n    fulfilled: This means the request was completed successfully and the results will be returned.\n    rejected: As it sounds, the operation failed. This will return a reason for the rejection.\n\nA few approaches to handle the results of Promises, we can either chain then() methods with a catch() or use Async/Await. Note: If using Async/Await, it is a good idea to wrap it in a try-catch block to handle a possible rejection.",

            answer:
              'From Wikipedia:\n\nIn computing, tree shaking is a dead code elimination technique that is applied when optimizing code written in ECMAScript dialects like Dart, JavaScript, or TypeScript into a single bundle that is loaded by a web browser. Rather than eliminating code that can never be executed, tree shaking starts from entry point and includes only the code that is guaranteed to be executed.[1] It is succinctly described as "live code inclusion".\nHistory\n\nDead code elimination in dynamic languages is a much harder problem than in static languages. The idea of a "treeshaker" originated in LISP[2] in the 1990s. The idea is that all possible execution flows of a program can be represented as a tree of function calls, so that functions that are never called can be eliminated.\n\nThe algorithm was applied to JavaScript in Google Closure Tools and then to Dart in the dart2js compiler also written by Google, presented by Bob Nystrom in 2012[3][4] and described by the book "Dart in Action" by author Chris Buckett in 2013:\n\n    When code is converted from Dart to JavaScript the compiler does \'tree shaking\'. In JavaScript you have to add an entire library even if you only need it for one function, but thanks to tree shaking the Dart-derived JavaScript only includes the individual functions that you need from a library\n    — Chris Buckett\n\nThe next wave of popularity of the term is attributed to Rich Harris\'s Rollup project[5] developed in 2015.\nRelation to ECMAScript 6 modules\n\nThe popularity of tree shaking in JavaScript is based on the fact that in distinction from CommonJS modules, ECMAScript 6 module loading is static and thus the whole dependency tree can be deduced by statically parsing the syntax tree. Thus tree shaking becomes an easy problem. However, tree shaking does not only apply at the import/export level: it can also work at the statement level, depending on the implementation.[citation needed] ',

              "A clip from:\nhttps://www.katalon.com/resources-center/blog/ci-cd-introduction/\n\n\nCI/CD is the acronym for the combined practices of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). CI/CD practices are currently the most widely accepted choice to shorten software development and delivery cycle time.\n\n\nWhat is Continuous Integration?\n\nIn a CI practice, developers build, run, and test code on their own workstations before committing code to the version control repository. After changes are made to the repository, a chain of events is put into motion. A typical first step in this chain is to build the latest version of source code. If the build is successful, unit tests are executed. If unit testing succeeds, the build is deployed to test environments where system tests are performed (usually using automated tests). The team is notified about the status of this process, and a report is delivered to provide details, such as build number, defects, and the number of tests.\n\n\nWhat is Continuous Delivery?\n\nCD makes it possible to release builds to the production environment when needed. Allowing the team to deploy at will, CD effectively reduces time to market.\n\nBefore deploying software to production, the CD process includes performing automated system testing, unit testing (including API testing and load testing), and integration testing. The steps from CI to CD are usually completed automatically, including automated testing at the unit, integration, and system levels. As tests can fail at any level and environment, CI/CD must include a feedback channel to quickly report failures to developers.",

It is unlikely anyone would speak ill of themselves, but stumbling through or throwing out a bunch of catch phrases like "I am a hard worker" without any detail can be telling. If we take pride in what we do, how we do it and how we treat others, we should be proud enough to talk about it.\n\nUltimately, we just need to give a brief bit of detail about why something about us or our work is good. "I am a hard worker" followed up with how teammates always know, perhaps even commented, that we would get the job done and meet deadlines. Perhaps a bit about how some colleagues have become good friends. Maybe a little highlighting of how a boss liked to throw complicated or new things at us because he or she knew how well we can handle ourselves. This will all, of course, be personal and unique, but the general idea is just to showcase the positive affects that our personality, work ethic and passion have had on the people we worked with and the companies we worked for.\n\n\n',

              'This question is sometimes asked because it is more of an intermediate to advanced topic, given that it deals with both how things are layered, how an element\'s parent affects this and how the position property setting can change things.\n\n\tHere are the basics to know:\n\t- z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky).\n\n\t- Elements usually stack with the items that are lower in the DOM appearing on top. z-index can change that for an element using a integer. The higher the number, the higher it goes on the element stack.\n\n\t- Understanding how the parent-child relationship works is very important for understanding how z-index will affect the elements. If element A has children, but element B sits on top of it, then no child element A can ever be higher than element B. No matter how high we make the z-index setting. \n\n\t- You can animate z-index, but it is either behind or in front of an element. It will not transition from one to the other. \n\n\tAn example that can be dropped into an online editor like https://codepen.io/pen/ :\n\n\n\t\tCSS\n\t\t\tdiv {\n\t\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\t\tbackground: black;\n\t\t\tcolor: white;\n\t\t\twidth: 100%;\n\t\t\ttop: 35%;\n\t\t\ttext-align: center;\n\t\t\tpadding: 1em\n\t\t}\n\n\t\timg {\n\t\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\t\tleft: 25%;\n\t\t\ttop: 0;\n\t\t\tz-index: -1;\n\t\t\tmargin: 0 auto;\n\t\t}\n\n\n\t\tHTML\n\t\t    <div><h1>Toggle the image\'s z-index property to watch it go backwards and forwards.</h1>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random" width="50%">\n',

Due to the difficulty in retrofitting CSP into existing websites, CSP is mandatory for all new websites and is strongly recommended for all existing high-risk sites.\n\nThe primary benefit of CSP comes from disabling the use of unsafe inline JavaScript. Inline JavaScript – either reflected or stored – means that improperly escaped user-inputs can generate code that is interpreted by the web browser as JavaScript.

[1] A/B tests consist of a randomized experiment with two variants, A and B.[2][3] It includes application of statistical hypothesis testing or "two-sample hypothesis testing" as used in the field of statistics. A/B testing is a way to compare two versions of a single variable, typically by testing a subject\'s response to variant A against variant B, and determining which of the two variants is more effective.[4] \n\n\nHere is a nice excerpt from this article:\nhttps://crossbrowsertesting.com/blog/visual-testing/ab-testing-screenshots/\n\n"One of the more common testing practices that marketers experiment with is A/B testing, which lets you test two scenarios at once to determine which your audience responds to better. This is done by having control and variable scenarios, which are randomly displayed to users when they visit your site.\n\nThese changes can be as small as testing the color of a CTA button to seeing whether adding a video on a landing page will increase registrations. For example, one user may see a green “Sign Up Now” button, while the other sees a red one. During an A/B test, you may look to see which one gets more clicks in order to inform which color you want to set the button to."\n\nA/B testing tools from a list complied in:\nhttps://www.ventureharbour.com/best-a-b-testing-tools/\n\nGoogle Analytics & Google Optimize - Free\nOptimizely\nVWO\nZoho PageSense\nHubSpot\nLeadformly\nUnbounce\nConvertize\nKameleoon\nConvert\n',

            answer:
              'A very complete answer from:\nhttps://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-create-a-multicolor-text-in-html-and-css.html\n\nYou can create a multicolor text with the help of image editors such as Pixelmator, Photoshop and so on. So, you can create a multicolor image and embed it into your website.\nThe multicolor text will not be searchable with this method.\n\nAs a result, your code will look like the following:\n\n<img src="multicolortext.png"/>\n\nMake separate elements¶\n\nAnother way is creating a text with separate elements by using the HTML <span> tag, which is an empty container. This means that you create a multicolor text by putting each letter in a separate element to define a different color for each letter of your text.\nExample of creating a multicolor text with separate elements in HTML:¶\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Title of the document</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <span style="color:#FF0000">H</span>\n    <span style="color:#66CC66">e</span>\n    <span style="color:#FF9966">l</span>\n    <span style="color:#FFCCCC">l</span>\n    <span style="color:#FF0066">o</span>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\nTry it Yourself »\nResult¶\nUse CSS¶\n\nAnd finally, you can use CSS. This is the easiest way of creating such kind of text.\n\nPut your text in a <span> tag and give it a class name "multicolortext". Then, you need the CSS background-image property to add a gradient background to your text with its "linear-gradient" value, where you put the names of your preferred colors.\n\nTo get multicolor text instead of the multicolor background, you need to use the background-clip property, which lets you control how far a background image or color extends beyond the element\'s padding or content. This step gives some colors to your text, but not exactly what you want.\n\nYou can get the final result by making your text color transparent with the color property so that the background color will be reflected in the text.\nExample of creating a multicolor text with HTML and CSS:¶\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>The title of the document</title>\n    <style>\n      .multicolortext {\n        background-image: linear-gradient(to left, violet, indigo, green, blue, yellow, orange, red);\n        -webkit-background-clip: text;\n        -moz-background-clip: text;\n        background-clip: text;\n        color: transparent;\n      }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>\n      <span class="multicolortext">Let’s be creative!</span>\n    </h1>\n  </body>\n</html>',

              "The applet HTML element, which was used in the past to embed Java applications in an HTML document, was introduced and simultaneously deprecated in favor of the object element when the HTML 4.01 specification was released in December of 1999. However, that didn’t stop developers from using the element which had been made available and functional by the release of the Java browser plugin in 1995.\n\nApplets are small programs that can be embedded within web pages to perform some specific functionality, such as computations, animations, and information processing. Applets are written using the Java language.",

In addition, below are some ideas to include.\n\nWhat code quality standards does the team follow? - This highlights that we care about code quality while giving us an idea of the company's focus.\n\n\tFollowing up this question based on their reply, we can ask:\n\t\t- What is the version control branching strategy..or do they use branches?\n\t\t- What kind of testing do they use? Unit tests? End-to-end tests?\n\t\t- Do they use any sort of feature-toggling?\n\t\t- Do they use continuous integration, continuous delivery or continuous deployment?\n\t\t\t(detail on those: https://tinyurl.com/ybty6fw3)\n\t\t- What is the QA process like?\n\nWhat project or team would I start on? - This shows we care about what we will be doing and who we will be doing it with. We can also see if the project interests us and, most importantly, if we are able to meet the team we are able to see if they seem happy. Even if only a a few names or the team lead's name is given, we might be able to do some research and find out about the people that might be our colleagues. \n\nWhy are you interested in hiring me? \n\n\t\t\t- OR -\n\nWhat are a few reasons you would hire me?\n\n\t- However it is asked, this is a good last question. The purpose is to get them thinking of why they would want to hire us. It also puts them on the spot to think about and say a few nice things about us. After the interview there will be a point when the decision makers will consider what they liked and what didn't grab them, but they will have already begun thinking about the good stuff before we even leave the room.\n\n\nThis last one is a statement instead of a question. We just got them thinking about why they would want to hire us, now we want to detail for them how we are perfect for this role.\n\n\tA few ideas for this:\n\t\t- Highlight the core technologies they use and our experience with them.\n\t\t- Our side projects and how we have continued learning.\n\t\t- Our passion for making teams work and helping other team members get better through solid communication, being calm and positive, mentoring when needed and keeping focused on solutions and goals instead of disagreements.\n\t\t- Anything that we feel we offer and, especially, what sets us apart.

Adding to this with third-party API's experience, like the Braintree API, or Slack API, can help showcase real-world experience.\n\n\n\nA few options are:\n\t- Geolocations\n\n\t\t        if (navigator.geolocation) {\n\t\t            navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((pos) => {\n\t\t                console.log('Got Location', pos);\n\t\t            }, () => {\n\t\t                console.log('nope')\n\t\t            });\n\t\t        }\n\n\n\n- Media API: This API works for both audio and video. There are a number of methods including play() and pause() as well as load().\n\n- Text Track API: Picking up where the Media API leaves off, the Text Track API allows us to interact with text tracks (subtitles or captions) for the audio and videos.\n\n- Drag and Drop: There are a number of possibilities with this API. Among these, you can add  'draggable' attribute to allow a user to move an element then have event handlers in place on a drop zone so the browser knows where the element can be dropped.\n\n- History API: This spec gives developers more control of the user's browser session. Along with moving the the user forward or backward, we can check the length of the history and even add or remove entries. We can hold data enabling us to restore a page or just update the URL without refreshing the page.\n",

              'Accessibility has become a very big focus for many companies. Knowing they are hiring people that can support this effort is important. The goal for an answer to any question about accessibility is to show that we have a basic understanding combined with being able to about real-world use.\n\nAccessibility is no longer just something nice to incorporate, it is essential for making sure people, best practices and, in some cases, laws are being respected. \n\nA few accessibility features we can incorporate:\n\nThoughtful contrasting colors for people who have trouble seeing color. This allows them to see a difference between two colored areas.\n\nAria labels are important for signalling correct detail to screen readers.\n\nUsing tags instead of CSS properties, like <em> instead of font-weight, will signal to screen-readers the intent to emphasis. This can then be past along to the user.\nThere are tools available, like Lighthouse now included in Chrome Dev Tools, that can run scans and alert us to accessibility concerns.\n\n\nHere is an example of the <em> and an aria label:\n\n\n    <p>Hi my name is Sheev Palpatine, but you can call me <em>EMPORER DARTH SIDIOUS</em></p>\n\n    <button aria-label="Close Modal">Close</button>',

HTTP2 adds a number of features to manage the streams, but leaves old semantics untouched.\n\n\nHTTP/2 supports queries multiplexing, headers compression, priority and more intelligent packet streaming management. This results in reduced latency and accelerates content download on modern web pages.",

It is important to separate concerns for multi-faceted projects like web pages.\n\n\t<h1 style="color: blue;">Example</h1>\n\n- <style> tags in the documents <head> can be used to assign selectors to declarations. The browser will then link classes used on the elements in the <body> to the selectors in the <style> tag. This will apply CSS to the page.\n\n\tThis is better than inline styles, but still not ideal as we are not separating the styling from the structure.\n\n\t<style>\n        .selector-name {\n            color: red;\n        }\n    </style>\n\n- The most versatile, clear and maintainable method is using external style sheets. We can bring these in using a <link> tag in the document\'s <head>. The browser will then using the selctors in the external style sheet to link to classes on the page elements and apply the associated declarations.\n\n\tThe most versatile, clear and maintainable because it enables a sheet, or sheets, with only CSS-related material. We can group selectors as we see fit and even separate them into separate sheets when the need arises. If anyone ever needs to jump in, they will have a much easier time finding what they need and making changes over the inline or <style> tag methods.\n\n\t<link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css">\n',

              "Many of us will naturally move between jobs and for a variety of reasons. This can sometimes be concerning for a company as they might think that makes us a short-term investment or, much worse, a bad investment due to some inability to get along with people or perform.\nThis question is our opportunity to remove these doubts. A simple explanation can go a long way, even if there was a bad situation and we can speak to how we learned from it.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with wanting to make more money or move up in role or even just find a culture that meshes better with our values, work ethic and/or future goals. We just need to give a brief reasoning that includes our thoughts surrounding big moves, our steps to work with our current employer before making th e moves and how those decisions ended up being good or, perhaps, lessons that we learned from those that did not.\n\nUltimately, we don't want to lie or give the impression we are trying to cover anything up. There are always reasons and many of them are good reasons. Taking advantage of opportunities for personal or professional advancement are definitely good reasons. On the other side, some reasons are lessons that are part of our growth.\n",

            answer:
              "This question is designed to see our thought process on this issue.\n\nHere are some basic steps for approaching a slow app:\n\n\t1. Define the specific problem. What, specifically is slow? Is the initial load slow? Are page transitions slow? Do the interactions, like menu animations, seem slow or choppy? Does this occur on only some browsers or devices? \n\n\t\tUltimately, the goal here is to get as clear a picture as possible as of each part that is slow. This enables us to find the best spots to begin drilling down.\n\n\t2. Narrow the scope: Next we want to take our drill-down points and begin to narrow each of those to as small a piece of code as we can. \n\n\t\tFor instance, if the issue is slow loading, a good place to start is either Chrome Dev Tools' Lighthouse tool or a page speed analyzer. One popular one is: \n\n\t\thttps://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/\n\n\t\tThese tools can help see where it is slow, like the first paint or how long until a user can actually interact with the page. From there it can help us pinpoint potential problem areas, like large images or slow server response.\n\n\t\tin a browser's dev tools we can use other tools, like the Network section to see detail on specific items like when they loaded, how long they took and if they were blocking progress. \n\n\t\tIf the issue is something not related to resources loading, dev tools can help narrow down the search using the Debugger, Performance, Inspector, Console and others. \n\n\t3. Isolate: Once we gained an understanding of the specific symptoms and then narrowed the scope of our attention, we can now address these specific areas of code. Dev tools Debugger can be great for stepping through JavaScript. The Performance tool can help see how an animation affects the page processing. \n\n\t\tIf need be, it can help to isolate specific blocks of code in a separate editor, perhaps even an online editor like repl.it, codepen.io or jsbin.com. This can help zero-in on specific problems in the code.\n\t\tAlong the same line of thinking, commenting out blocks of code and/or temporarily inserting new simplified code can help ensure we have properly identified the problem area.\n\n\t4. Fix: By this point, we have arrived at the problem pieces of code. Now, we just need to correct the issue.\n\n\t5. Test...a lot: We have not fixed the problem at this point. We have only written the code that we think will correct the issue. Test. Test. Test then take a break...test again. At that point, we have fixed teh issue.",

              'There are a wide array of strategies for this answer. Below are a few basic approaches, though a web search (click the "More About this Question" button for that) will yield a wealth of detail and other options.\n\n- We can just give an amount we would like to make and we think we are worth. it is simple and direct, though it might be a factor in eliminating us from the candidate list if the number far exceeds what the company wants to spend on the position or thinks we are worth. This approach is not concerned with staying in market value. It is more about weeding out companies that can not or do not wish to pay what we value our services at. \n\n- We can take our current salary and just raise that a little. Assuming we are applying for a similar position, or even slightly elevated, this keeps us around market range. \n\n- If the job is meant to be an entry into a new career, pushing for more money might hurt the greater purpose. We might want to consider looking for the salary range listed in the job post and speaking to an amount towards the middle, with a minimum around the listed minimum. Or, perhaps, if our situation is one where little more or less would not matter and getting in the door is the focus, being honest about this can be OK. It would be best to also ask how soon someone is eligible for a raise and to make sure they do not offer below their posted minimum. There are some who would say never ask for or imply the offered minimum, but getting the first foot in can make a tremendous difference and then enable us to make the next interview about what we are really worth.\n\n- Use online tools to find a market salary range and then ask for a salary somewhere between the average and the top salary depending on where our skills and experience put us.\n\n\n\tA few tools for finding market value:\n\n\t\tGlassDoor: https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/index.htm\n\t\tPayScale: https://www.payscale.com/my/survey/choose\n\t\tLinkedin Salary Tool: https://www.linkedin.com/salary/',

            answer:
              'This answer comes from:\nhttps://resource-centre.net/html5-tutorials/bullet-point-lists/\n\nBullet Point Lists (or Unordered Lists)\n\nThe first kind of list we will look at is using bullets.\nUnordered List – the <ul> Tag\n\nBullet point lists are also known as unordered lists (UL) because there is no numbering involved. That is why a bulleted list uses the <ul> </ul> tag pair. Here is a basic example:\n\nThe whole list is surrounded by <ul> </ul> for a start. When you open your list tag, make sure you automatically type your closing tag and then proceed to fill your items between them.\nThe type Attribute\n\nThe type attribute determines what kind of bullet you are seeing on the page. Although through CSS you can specify a wide-range of bullet styles, and even use your own image, in raw HTML it is best to stick with the common types which are\n\n    type="circle" – an unfilled circle\n\n    type="disc" – a filled circle\n\n    type="square" – a filled square\n\nList Items – the <li> Tag\n\nEach individual item in your list is wrapped in its own <li> </li> tag pair. You can often get away without the </li> but I would recommend keeping it in, just so you maintain healthy coding habit.\n\nThe list above I placed in individual <ul> but each <li> also supports the type attribute, such that I could create\n\n    Square\n    Disc\n    Circle\n\nNot sure why you would want to do that, but you can if you want to!\n\nBullet List Indentation\n\nBefore you apply any CSS to your list, HTML (or more accurately, your browser) will apply indentation to your list, so it stands out from your normal paragraph <p> tags.\nOrdered / Numbered Lists – the <ol> Tag\n\nIf you want to present your list in an ordered fashion, then the <ol> tag is your friend. By default this will give you a numbered list, but the type attribute gives you flexibility, in the same way as bullet point lists do.\n\nwhich outputs\n\n    Item 1\n    Item 2\n    Item 3\n\nThe type attribute offers a few more options in ordered lists compared to bulleted ones. A bit more guidance on this can be obtained at W3Schools.\nStarting an Ordered List On A Different Number\n\nSay you were putting together some instructions to build a table. You may want to use a numbered list to achieve this. However, if you wanted to put images and extra text between each stage, you would probably need multiple lists. The problem is that each list starts at number 1 (or letter A) by default. That would screw up your instructions!\n\nThankfully HTML has the start property to allow you to start on a subsequent number:\n\nThis outputs:\n\n    Step Four\n    Step Five\n    Step Six\n\nReversing The Order\n\nIf you want to show your numbers (or letters) in reverse order, then this is really easy too. You might want to do a ‘Top 10’ with your best item announced last, for example. This can be done by adding the word reversed into your Ordered List opening tag:\n\nAnd this would make your list look like this:\n\n    First LI\n    Second LI\n    Third LI\n    Fourth LI\n    Fifth LI\n\nMulti-Level Bullet List in HTML\n\nWith patchy browser support (and sometimes undone by CSS in some sites) you can create a multilevel list. This is achieved by embedding one list inside another:\n\nWhich creates:\n\n    Top Level Item\n        Sub-Item 1\n        Sub-Item 2\n    Top Level Item\n\nYou can use a combination of <ul> and <ol>. That may be useful if you want bullet points under a numbered list.\n\n    Top Level Item\n        Sub-Item 1\n        Sub-Item 2\n    Top Level Item\n',

Perhaps even a story about a time when kept our calm when others did not, or an example of how we set aside things that bothered us, and were able to generate harmony that helped move a project forward. All of this needs to be delivered, like all of our answers, with good eye contact without staring, enthusiasm married with a calm and thoughtful approach and general good will and respectful manner.

              'The following excerpt come from bitofco.de:\nhttps://bitsofco.de/understanding-the-virtual-dom/\n\nWhy do we need a virtual DOM?\n\nTo understand why the concept of the virtual DOM arose, let’s revisit the original DOM. As I mentioned, there are two parts to the DOM - the object-based representation of the HTML document and the API to manipulating that object.\n\nFor example, let’s take this simple HTML document with an unordered list and one list item.\n\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang="en">\n <head></head>\n <body>\n    <ul class="list">\n        <li class="list__item">List item</li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\n\nThis document can be represented as the following DOM tree:\n\nhtml\nhead lang="en"\nbody\nul class="list"\nli class="list__item"\n"List item"\n\nLet’s say we want to modify the content of the first list item to \n"List item one"\n and also add a second list item. To do this, we will need use the DOM APIs to find the elements we want to update, create the new elements, add attributes and content, then finally update the DOM elements themselves.\n\nconst listItemOne = document.getElementsByClassName("list__item")[0];\nlistItemOne.textContent = "List item one";\n\nconst list = document.getElementsByClassName("list")[0];\nconst listItemTwo = document.createElement("li");\nlistItemTwo.classList.add("list__item");\nlistItemTwo.textContent = "List item two";\nlist.appendChild(listItemTwo);\n\nThe DOM wasn’t made for this…\n\nWhen the first specification for the DOM was released in 1998, we built and managed web pages in very differently. There was far less reliance on the DOM APIs to create and update the page content as frequently as we do today.\n\nSimple methods such as \ndocument.getElementsByClassName()\n are fine to use on a small scale, but if we are updating multiple elements on a page every few seconds, it can start to become really expensive to constantly query and update the DOM.\n\nEven further, because of the way the APIs are setup, it is usually simpler to perform more expensive operations where we update larger parts of the document than to find and update the specific elements. Going back to our list example, it is in some ways easier to replace the entire unordered list with a new one than to modify the specific elements.\n\nconst list = document.getElementsByClassName("list")[0];\nlist.innerHTML = `\n<li class="list__item">List item one</li>\n<li class="list__item">List item two</li>\n`;\n\n\nIn this particular example, the performance difference between the methods is probably insignificant. However, as the size of the web page grows, it becomes more important to only select and update what is needed.\n\n… but the virtual DOM was!\n\nThe virtual DOM was created to solve these problems of needing to frequently update the DOM in a more performant way. Unlike the DOM or the shadow DOM, the virtual DOM isn\'t an official specification, but rather a new method of interfacing with the DOM.\n\nA virtual DOM can be thought of as a copy of the original DOM. This copy can be frequently manipulated and updated, without using the DOM APIs. Once all the updates have been made to the virtual DOM, we can look at what specific changes need to be made to the original DOM and make them in a targetted and optimised way.',

              "Questions about components can usually be answered either generally or specific to a framework, if we choose. We just need to demonstrate an understanding of the core concepts.\n\nThere have been the addition of web components native to the browser. modern frameworks have already had components built in for a while.\n\nA component will usually have an HTML template that we can pass in properties or other data. This allows us to build a component once and then use it multiple times. \n\nCommon uses are a navigation menu or model or buttons. These components can really be anything that we might want to use multiple times.\n\nEach component is encapsulated to ensure internal code will not collide with any document they are used in.\n\n\n\nWeb Component example from MDN (frameworks' syntax can be different):\n\nThis would be in a word-count.js file:\n\n// Create a class for the element\nclass WordCount extends HTMLParagraphElement {\n  constructor() {\n    // Always call super first in constructor\n    super();\n\n    // count words in element's parent element\n    const wcParent = this.parentNode;\n\n    function countWords(node){\n      const text = node.innerText || node.textContent;\n      return text.split(/\\s+/g).length;\n    }\n\n    const count = `Words: ${countWords(wcParent)}`;\n\n    // Create a shadow root\n    const shadow = this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});\n\n    // Create text node and add word count to it\n    const text = document.createElement('span');\n    text.textContent = count;\n\n    // Append it to the shadow root\n    shadow.appendChild(text);\n\n    // Update count when element content changes\n    setInterval(function() {\n      const count = `Words: ${countWords(wcParent)}`;\n      text.textContent = count;\n    }, 200);\n  }\n}\n\n// Define the new element\ncustomElements.define('word-count', WordCount, { extends: 'p' });\n\n\n\nHere is how to use it in a document:\n<script src=\"word-count.js\"></script>\n<p is=\"word-count\"></p>",

Underneath it uses operating system user interface methods all for drawing basic items like combo boxes and windows. \n\n    JavaScript interpreter: Used to parse and execute JavaScript code.\n\n    Data storage: The browser may need to save all sorts of data locally, such as cookies.

In some cases, authentication can be part of this connection. This might be a JSON web token, or some other data, included in the request.\n- The server will then send the requested data to the browser.\n- The browser will then render the page to the screen. \n\n- The new web page might include dependencies, like CSS ot JavaScript sheets, or images, etc. The browser will then either request these via the same connection, or, if the begin the process for a new connection to retrieve each item.\n\n- Once the browser page (tab or window) is closed, the connection to the server ends.\n\n",

Our goal is to show that we not only have dealt with conflict but that we have thought about it and worked through the difficult aspects. The worst thing we can do is not have an answer, or say we have never encountered any conflict. That is not realistic and it leaves the question wide open as to what they can expect from us if we encounter conflict while working there. Even a story about how we handled conflict poorly is fine, as long as we can talk clearly about how we thought and felt at the time and how we eventually learned how to handle it all better. \n\nTo put it simply:\n\tBe human. \n\tShow growth. \n\tShow thought. \n\tShow intent to understand others, even if they are acting poorly. \n\tShow a desire to explore the finer points of human interaction.\n\tShow that all of the above maters enough to have carefully thought about it.\n",

Led by Web inventor and Director Tim Berners-Lee and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe, W3C\'s mission is to lead the Web to its full potential.\n\n\nWhat does W3C do?\n\nW3C\'s primary activity is to develop protocols and guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the Web. W3C\'s standards define key parts of what makes the World Wide Web work. Learn more about W3C\'s mission.\nWhere is W3C located?\n\nW3C does not have a single physical headquarters. There are four institutions, however, that "host" W3C: MIT (in Cambridge, MA, USA), ERCIM (in Sophia-Antipolis, France), Keio University (near Tokyo, Japan), and Beihang University (in Beijing, China).\n\nThe W3C staff is distributed around the world, but there are concentrations of people in Cambridge, Massachusetts (USA), Sophia-Antipolis (France), and Tokyo (Japan). In addition, W3C is represented in 17 other regions of the world via representatives based at organizations. W3C calls these regional points of contact "W3C Offices."\nHow is W3C funded?\n\nW3C receives funds from:\n\n    W3C Member dues\n    Research grants and other sources of private and public funding\n    Individual donations of money and equipment \n\nWhat is the difference between the Web and the Internet?\n\nFrom the definition in the Wikipedia: "The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that interchange data by packet switching using the standardized Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)."\n\nThus, the Internet is a network of networks, defined by the TPC/IP standards.\n\nThe Web, on the other hand, is defined in W3C\'s Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume I as follows: "The World Wide Web (WWW, or simply Web) is an information space in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI)."\n\nThus, the Web is an information space.

              "What is async, defer, preload and prefetch for loading JavaScript documents",
            answer:
              'All of this addresses the loading of documents and how they affect the main document.\n\nFrom:https://javascript.info/script-async-defer\n\n\nDEFER:\n\nThe defer attribute tells the browser not to wait for \nthe script. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, \nbuild DOM. The script loads “in the background”, and then runs when the \nDOM is fully built.\n\nHere’s the same example with defer:\n<p>...content before script...</p>\n\n<scrip/t defer src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js?speed=1"></scrip/t>\n\n<!-- visible immediately -->\n<p>...content after script...</p>\n\n\nIn other words:\n\n    - Scripts with defer never block the page.\n    - Scripts with defer always execute when the DOM is ready (but before DOMContentLoaded event).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASYNC\n\nThe async attribute is somewhat like \ndefer. It also makes the script non-blocking. But it has important differences in the behavior.\n\nThe async attribute means that a script is completely independent:\n\n    - The browser doesn’t block on async scripts (like defer).\n    - Other scripts don’t wait for async scripts, and async scripts don’t wait for them.\n    - DOMContentLoaded and async scripts don’t wait for each other:\n        | DOMContentLoaded may happen both before an async script (if an async script finishes loading after the page is complete)\n        | …or after an async script (if an async script is short or was in HTTP-cache)\n\n    <p>...content before scripts...</p>\n\n    <scrip/t>\n      document.addEventListener(\'DOMContentLoaded\', () => alert("DOM ready!"));\n    </scrip/t>\n\n    <scrip/t async src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js"></scrip/t>\n    <scrip/t async src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/small.js"></scrip/t>\n\n    <p>...content after scripts...</p>\n\n\n\nThe following examples come from: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/html-preload-prefetch\n\n\n    \nPRELOAD\n\nPreloading JavaScript resources is done differently. This example, taken from this Google Developers article on preloading, shows this:\nindex.html\n\n<link rel="preload" href="used-later.js" as="scrip/t">\n<!-- ... -->\n<scrip/t>\n  var usedLaterScript = document.createElement(\'script\');\n  usedLaterScript.src = \'used-later.js\';\n  document.body.appendChild(usedLaterScript);\n</scrip/t>\n\n\n\nPREFETCH\n\nPrefetching works similarly to preloading. The difference is that, \nwhen prefetching a resource, the browser considers the resource to be \nlow priority. This means that the resource or asset will load a bit \nlater. Because of this, prefetching is usually implemented with \nresources that are not required initially, but are used at a later \npoint.\n\nTo implement prefectching in your HTML page, change the value of \nrel to "prefetching.\n\nindex.html\n<link\n  rel="prefetch"\n  as="style"\n  onload="this.rel = \'stylesheet\'"\n  href=\'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:100,900|Material+Icons\'>\n',

              'This is generally asked to get an idea of how much someone pays attention to good practices and, ultimately, will write easier to understand code and have an easier time jumping into someone else\'s code.\n\nGeneral naming conventions:\n-\tNames should be brief, but descriptive enough that the average non-developer could understand. For example, using "d = new Date()" might serve brevity, but can make no sense later in the program and require extra effort to understand. Conversely, "theDateForTheDayTheAppIsRun = new Date()" is clear, but unnecessarily long. Simply "todaysDate = new Date()" is brief and easily understood.\n\nA few JavaScript examples can be:\n- Camel case for variables: const lastName = \'Kenobi\'\n- Pascal case for classes: class MainCharacter { }\n- "is" or "has" prefix for booleans.\n- Function calls that will be returning something can start with have a descriptive verb ("update", "get", etc).\n- As few variables as possible. This is not really a naming convention, but it greatly affects the abilty for the names of the variables that do get used to be easier to follow and keep track of.\n- Do not re-use variable names.\n- In many cases it is better not to make a variable equal itself with modification. This can be difficult to follow through and can often be better served with a new, variable descriptively named to match the newly formed data.\n- When reasonable, if a specific item in an array is being used, assign a more descriptive variable: const updatedFileId = changes[0]\n- Property names that do not need to be prefixed with the class name. \n\tWe do not need: class Car {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructor(brand, purchaseDate) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.carName = brand;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.carYear = purchaseDate;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n} \n\tInstead, we can use: class Car {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructor(brand) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.name = brand;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.year = purchaseDate;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t} \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t// in use it will still be descriptive\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconst myCar = new Car();\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmyCar,name = \'Jeep\';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmyCar.year = \'2017\';\n- Avoid "magic" numbers, or numbers without a name, when possible. \n\tWe want to avoid: const forwardMovement = duration * 3;\n\tWe can use: const rate = 3;\n\t\t\t\t  forwardMovement = duration * rate;\n\t\t\t\t \n\nCSS & HTML examples:\n- Use nicely cascading rules to make for as few selectors as possible.\n- Kabab case for selectors: .inner-wrap\n- Descriptive selector names. This can be the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) method or similar.\n- Try to avoid using the same name for an ID and a class. These are technically independent from each other, but this can cause confusion for a developer.\n',

This is often not ideal, as we are generally better off knowing how many parameters we will be passing, but for the occasions where we do not, the Rest operator makes for a clean, readable and powerful tool.\n\n\nfunction sum(...theArgs) {\n  let total = 0;\n  for (const arg of theArgs) {\n    total += arg;\n  }\n  return total;\n}\n\nconsole.log(sum(1, 2, 3));\n// Expected output: 6\n\nconsole.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4));\n// Expected output: 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spread (...) syntax allows an iterable, such as an array or string, to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected. In an object literal, the spread syntax enumerates the properties of an object and adds the key-value pairs to the object being created.\n\nSpread syntax looks exactly like rest syntax. In a way, spread syntax is the opposite of rest syntax. Spread syntax "expands" an array into its elements, while rest syntax collects multiple elements and "condenses" them into a single element. See rest parameters and rest property.\n\nfunction sum(x, y, z) {\n\n  return x + y + z;\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3];\n\n\n\n\nconsole.log(sum(...numbers));\n\n// Expected output: 6\n\n\n\n\nconsole.log(sum.apply(null, numbers));\n\n// Expected output: 6\n\n\n',

              'This might sound like a silly question, but questions like this sometimes are used to get us to show our understanding of basic, but often needed, aspects of CSS. This will usually be a screening question, so a descriptive verbal outline will needed, not actual code.\n\nTo begin, we need to target our element via ID, or by class for multiple elements. We then want to set an equal width and height, perhaps 100px each. From there, we can either set the border for a few pixels or a background color or even both. This way we can see it. At that point, we have a square.\n\nMaking that square a circle simply requires a border-radius of 50% all of the way around. \n\nNow, that is a fixed width square or circle. We could make it responsive by using a percentage as the width and an equal percentage as padding-bottom. If there is content in the square or circle, one way to keep the sides equal would be to absolutely position the content. Ultimately, this is just an option. There are many ways to approach graphics in CSS, and purpose and the rest of the document will play into a plan for making the graphics responsive.\n\n\nPaste this example into an online editor, like https://codepen.io/pen/, to see the square and circle:\n\n\tCSS\n\t\t.square {\n\t\t\tbackground: lightgreen;\n\t\t\twidth: 50%;\n\t\t\tpadding-bottom: 50%;\n\t\t\tmargin: 0 auto;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t.square.circle {\n\t\t\tborder-radius: 50%;\n\t\t\tbackground: salmon;\n\t\t}\n\n\tHTML\n\t\t<div class="square"></div>\n\n\t\t<div class="square circle"></div>',

              "The days of great consideration being paid to Internet Explorer's many differences will, or possibly have, come to an end. This does not mean browser compatibility is no longer a concern. \nModern browsers are much more consistent with including features, but it is still good to check with a tool like https://caniuse.com/ or MDN to make sure new features are well covered.\n\nFor most browsers, we can easily download them and test our app. But what about older versions of each browser? What about these browsers on different devices. What if we need to test on Safari, but do not have access to a Mac? There are tools like https://www.browserstack.com/ to test web apps in many different ways. Some will even monitor real users on different browsers and devices. We can even have automated routines to test these scenarios.  \n\nBeyond testing, it is important that we know well what our target audience is going to be. If it is truly a global reach we are seeking, we need to consider things like Opera Mini (popular in parts of the world with slow internet), Baidu (a popular China-based browser), KaiOS' browser (mobile OS and browser used all over and especially in India) and any others that are used.\n\nAll of this does not mean that wide-reach intentions mean we need to remove most of our JavaScript just to make the app work right on Opera Mini. It just means just that we need to consider what happens to our product for the those users and work towards good solutions. \n\nWhithin any app, we should pay attention to current browser compatibility and utilize thinking along these lines:\n\n\t- We might just need to ensure there are fullbacks in place.\n\n\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\tposition: sticky; // Not fully supported by some browsers\n\n\t- We can plan our interactions and layouts so that nothing critical relies on technology not fully supported.\t\n\n\t- We can check for specific feature support in a browser and have separate functionality ready. This is not ideal as it requires extra consideration when maintaining the web app, but it is a workable solution.\n\n\t- We and the customer can consider the costs vs the gains related to supporting certain browsers. The benefits might not offset the costs of supporting a specific browser's use and/or the areas of the world it is popular.",

It can be used also to dynamically build selectors, but that feature is deprecated and replaced by different more powerful option.\n\nSyntax\n\nUse either ~"whatever" or ~\'whatever\' syntax to escape property values. Anything between quotes is used as is with almost no changes. The "as is" rule has one exception: string interpolation works with the usual @{variableName} syntax.\n\nUsed as Property Value\n\nSample input:\n\n@variable: "dynamic";\nh1 {\n  margin: 1 ~"2 2" 3;\n  padding: ~\'ms:special.syntax()\';\n  text: ~\'@{variable}\'; //interpolation works\n}\n\ncompiles into:\n\nh1 {\n  margin: 1 2 2 3;\n  padding: ms:special.syntax();\n  text: dynamic;\n}\n\n',

              "Excerpts from hacker.io:\n\nCSS was originally released in 1996 and consists of properties for adding font properties such as typeface and emphasis color of text, backgrounds, and other elements. CSS2 was released in 1998 with added styles for other media types so that it can be used for page layout designing. CSS3 was released in 1999 and presentation-style properties were added in it that allows you to build a presentation from documents.\n\nUnlike CSS2, which was comprised of a single document, CSS3 has its specifications divided into many individual modules, which makes CSS3 a whole lot easier to handle.\n\nWith CSS3, the designers can now use special fonts, like those available in Google Fonts and Typecast. Earlier, with CSS and CSS2, designers could only use “web-safe fonts” for being 100% sure to use fonts that would always display the same on every machine.\n\nWhile CSS and CSS2 had ‘simple selectors’, CSS3 calls the components as ‘a sequence of simple selectors’.\n\nCSS3 came up with some key web design considerations like rounded borders that help in rounding up the borders without any hassle. This turned out to be a huge plus point for developers who were struggling with initial versions of CSS borders.\n\nCSS3 has the capability to split text sections into multiple columns so that it can be read like a newspaper. In CSS2, the developers had difficulty because the standard was not equipped with automatically breaking the text so that it fits within a box.\n\n",

            answer:
              'Synchronous code runs from top to bottom in order. One line, command, function, etc is processed and resolved before moving to the next. This can be problematic if you encounter "blocking" code, which is code that causes processing one item for a longer amount of time. This means the rest of the program (and end user) wait until the program can mover on to the next line. This is where asynchronous code can be helpful.\n\nAsynchronous code runs separately from other code. This means it can take longer to process without "blocking" the rest of the program from running. In JavaScript, the Call Stack processes code synchronously. If a piece of asynchronous code is encountered, it is moved out of the Call Stack. If it is part of a Web API, like setTimeOut(), then the browser handles the resolving the code. Otherwise, it is moved to the Callback Que. In either case, the Event Loop will take the next item that has resolved, and place it on the Call Stack. This time, when the code can be dealt with in order because it is ready and will not block the processing the rest of the program.',

            level: "basic",
            answer:
              "Closure is an inner function, that is accessible outside of its parent function's scope while maintaining its connection to the parent's variables and other data. This can be don to keep some data private and purposely expose other data.\nTo accomplish this, an anonymous function can be immediately invoked. In this function, data we wish to keep  private can be processed. Usually this data would be removed from memory via JavaScript's \"garbage collection\" memory clearing process. If this function returns a function, let's call it a child function, that accesses data from the parent function, the parent's data will remain in memory. In this situation, the only access to the parent function's data will be via whatever had been set up in the child function. In addition, every time the child function is invoked, a new function scope is created for the child function. The parent function scope is only created once. This means that we can invoke the child function to change a variable in the parent and the next time we invoke the child function the variable in the parent will still reflect the change. \n\nThis can be considered state management and might not be as useful today given other options to manage state. Still, this process can be used to protect sensitive data or even just a to keep a counter variable from being accidentally increased.\n\nSome examples\n// For comparison, this is a counter without closure\nlet counter = 0;\n\nfunction add1 () {\n\tcounter++;\n\treturn counter;\n}\n\nconsole.log(add1());  // 1\nconsole.log(add1());  // 2\n// The counter becomes unpredictable when it can be altered elswhere\ncounter++;\nconsole.log(add1());  // 4\n\n\n// This is a counter with closure\nconst add1 = (function () {\n  let counter = 0;\n\n  return function () {\n\tcounter++;\n\treturn counter;\n  };\n})();\nconsole.log(add1());  // 1\nconsole.log(add1());  // 2\nconsole.log(add1());  // 3\ncounter++;// error: counter is not defined\nconsole.log(add1());\n\n// Another, more complex example\n// In this travelAgent() in the child function made available, while \n// the \"trip\" variable and agent() function are accessible through \n// travelAgent(). The book() function, is only accessible through agent().\nfunction vacation() {\n\tvar trip;\n\n\tfunction travelAgent(itinerary) {\n\t\tagent(itinerary);\n\t\treturn trip;\n\t}\n\n\tfunction agent(itinerary) {\n\t\tif (itinerary === 'Orlando') {\n\t\t\ttrip = ['Orlando', 'Disney', 'Universal'];\n\t\t\tbook();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tfunction book() {\n\t\ttrip.push('booked');\n\t}\n\treturn travelAgent;\n}\n\nvar myVacation = vacation();\n\nconsole.log(myVacation('Orlando'));\n\n// Array [ \"Orlando\", \"Disney\", \"Universal\", \"booked\" ]\n",

A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.\n\nO - Open-closed principle. Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.\n\nL - Liskov substitution principle. Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.\n\nI - Interface segregation principle. A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.\n\nD - Dependency Inversion Principle. Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.\n\nHere is a good article on the subject: https://dev.to/francescoxx/solid-principles-in-javascript-3pek\n",

So, it is easy for designers and developers to work more efficiently and quickly.\n    It is compatible with all versions of CSS. So, you can use any available CSS libraries.\n    It provides nesting so you can use nested syntax and useful functions like color manipulation, math functions and other values.\n\nDisadvantages\n\n    The developer must have enough time to learn new features present in this preprocessor before using it.\n    Using Sass may result in the loss of some benefits of a browser's built-in element inspector.",

              "This addresses what happens when passing data from one variable to another. More specifically, this is about where variables point. \n\nThe original variable points to a place in memory. The new variable can either point to the same place in memory, which means the reference to the data was passed, or the new variable can point to a new place in memory that contains the same data, which means the values were passed to the new memory location.\n\nThe main reason this is important is shown by the results of changing either variable. If only a reference was passed, meaning both variables point to the same data at the same memory location, then changing a value will change change it for both variables, as well as any others pointing to the same place in memory.\n\nIf the actual values were passed and reside at a new location in memory, changing the values at the new memory location will only be visible with the new variable (and any others pointing to that location). The original variable is still pointing at the old memory location and remains unchanged.\n\nExamples:\nlet example1 = 1;\nlet example2 = example1;\nexample2++;\n\nconsole.log(example1, ' - ', example2);\n\nconst example3 = {\n  weapon: 'lightsaber'\n};\nconst example4 = {\n  ...example3\n};\nexample4.name = 'Darth Vader';\nconsole.log(example3, ' - ', example4);",

It is positioned relative to the initial containing block established by the viewport, except when one of its ancestors has a transform, perspective, or filter property set to something other than none (see the CSS Transforms Spec), in which case that ancestor behaves as the containing block. (Note that there are browser inconsistencies with perspective and filter contributing to containing block formation.) Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left. \n\nThis value always creates a new stacking context.

The offset does not affect the position of any other elements. \n\nThis value always creates a new stacking context. Note that a sticky element "sticks" to its nearest ancestor that has a "scrolling mechanism" (created when overflow is hidden, scroll, auto, or overlay), even if that ancestor isn\'t the nearest actually scrolling ancestor.

              "Here is a video introduction to hooks:\nhttps://youtu.be/dpw9EHDh2bM\n\n\nHooks let you use state and other React features without writing a class.\n\n\nExample of the useState hook:\n\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Example() {\n  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call \"count\"  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\n        Click me\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nA few snippets from https://softwareontheroad.com/react-hooks/\n\n\n When you work with Reactjs class components you can use state, that’s why these components are also called stateful, also every class component has lifecycle methods like: componentDidMount(), componentDidUpdate(), and so on.\n\nYou can’t use any of this in functional components. Functional components can’t use their own state and don’t have lifecycle methods.\n\nNow with React hooks you can.\n\nReact hooks allows us to take a Reactjs functional component and add state and lifecycle methods to it.\n\nIn simple words, React hooks are special functions to extend the capabilities of functional components and give them the possibility to have lifecycle events and manage state.\n\n\nThe existing React hooks 🍱\n\nThe new API comes with two main pre-existing hooks, and some others for other use cases\nBasics React hooks\n\nThe foundation of all React hooks, every other hook you will see is a variation of these three or are using them as primitives.\n\n    useState is the State hook use it for declaring the state in your components\n    useEffect is the Side effects hook use it for data fetching, manually changing the DOM, and etc.\n    useContext use it in conjunction with Reactjs Context API. When the React Context provider updates, this hook will trigger render with the latest context value.\n\nAdvance React hooks\n\nThese are the most important of the other built-in React hooks that come with the library.\n\n    The useReducer is an alternative to useState, you should use it when you have complex state logic, if you’re familiar with Redux you will like it.\n    The useRef use it for accessing a DOM element with a mutable ref object. Is more useful than the ref attribute\n\n\n\nRules\n\n    Never call Hooks from inside a loop, condition or nested function\n    Never call a Hook from a regular function\n    Only call them inside functions components or custom hooks\n    Hooks should sit at the top level of your component\n    Hooks can call other Hooks\n\n\n\n",

If so, the values will always be identical.\n\nComparing unique objects can be a little more involved.

We can do this by checking if one has more keys than the other using Object.keys().length or Object.getOwnPropertyNames().length.\nWhen iterating through the objects, we must also account for the possibility of nested arrays and/or objects. These might even go many levels deep.\n\nOne way is to turn both objects into strings using JSON.stringify() and then compare the strings. This will ONLY work if we know the keys will always be IN THE SAME ORDER. When using this method, any variance, like a key being in a different place, will cause the comparison to fail even though the values might be identical.\n\nA more strict approach is to iterate through each object and check the key-value pair against the other. This will work even if the keys are not in the same order. \n\n\nconst user1 = {\n  first: 'Lando',\n  last: 'Calrissian'\n};\nconst user2 = {\n  first: 'Lando',\n  last: 'Calrissian'\n};\n\n\n// Direct comparison\nconsole.log(user1 === user2);  // false\n\n// Stringify process\nconst stringObj1 = JSON.stringify(user1);\nconst stringObj2 = JSON.stringify(user2);\n\nconsole.log(typeof stringObj1);  // string\nconsole.log(stringObj1 === stringObj2);  // true\n\n\n\n// Iterating process possibiltiy\nfunction isSameObject (obj1, obj2) {\n  const props1 = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj1);\n  const props2 = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj2);\n\n  if (props1.length !== props2.length) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < props1.length; i++) {\n    const property = props1[i];\n\n    if (props1[property] !== props2[property]) {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return true;\n}\n\nconsole.log(isSameObject(user1, user2));  // true",

              "A pseudo-element in CSS is similar to a pseudo-class in that it uses a keyword added to a selector, but he similarities end there. CSS pseudo-elements let us style a specific part of elements or even add to the beginning or end of the element. In addition, a pseudo-element will use double colons between the keyword and the selector. Technically, because this double-colon convention was not in place early on, the spec still allows this. That said, it is still expected that double colons are used.\n\n\nA few examples:\n\n::after - This creates an inline pseudo-element as the lst child of an element.\n\n::before - Similar to the above, this creates an inline pseudo-element as the first child of an element.\n\n::first-letter - This will apply styles to the first letter of the first line of an element.\n\n::first-line - This works like ::first-letter, but the style will apply to the whole line. What qualifies for the first line will depend on the width of the element, font size and other similar factors.\n\n::selection - When the user highlights a section, usually by clicking and dragging the mouse across text, we can style this highlighted area using the ::selection pseudo-element.\n\n\nDrop this example into an online editor, like https://codepen.io/pen/, to see a few of the pseudo-elements work their magic:\n\nCSS\n\tp::first-letter {\n\t\tfont-size: 50px;\n\t}\n\n\tp::first-line {\n\t\tcolor: orange;\n\t\tletter-spacing: 0.5em;\n\t}\n\n\tp::before {\n\t\tcontent: 'THIS IS BEFORE ---- ';\n\t\tcolor: darkblue;\n\t\tbackground-color: yellowgreen;\n\t}\n\n\tp::after {\n\t\tcontent: '--- THIS IS AFTER';\n\t\tbackground: gray;\n\t\tcolor: aquamarine;\n\t}\n\n\nHTML\n\t<p>The first line will be orange and have letter-spacing applied. The first line changes as the element size changes. The resat of the line will be black, except for the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements. \n\t</p>\n\n",

            answer:
              "A Promise is basically a placeholder for the results of a request. We can then use handlers based on the eventual success or failure of the request. Promises allow values to be returned much like synchronous methods, just not immediately. In the interim, the Promise, acting as the placeholder, allow the program to move on and will then provide the results of the request whenever they are ready.\n\nA Promise is always either:\n\n    pending: This is the default state. No value is ready nor has anything been rejected.\n    fulfilled: This means the request was completed successfully and the results will be returned.\n    rejected: As it sounds, the operation failed. This will return a reason for the rejection.\n\nA few approaches to handle the results of Promises, we can either chain then() methods with a catch() or use Async/Await. Note: If using Async/Await, it is a good idea to wrap it in a try-catch block to handle a possible rejection.",

            answer:
              'From Wikipedia:\n\nIn computing, tree shaking is a dead code elimination technique that is applied when optimizing code written in ECMAScript dialects like Dart, JavaScript, or TypeScript into a single bundle that is loaded by a web browser. Rather than eliminating code that can never be executed, tree shaking starts from entry point and includes only the code that is guaranteed to be executed.[1] It is succinctly described as "live code inclusion".\nHistory\n\nDead code elimination in dynamic languages is a much harder problem than in static languages. The idea of a "treeshaker" originated in LISP[2] in the 1990s. The idea is that all possible execution flows of a program can be represented as a tree of function calls, so that functions that are never called can be eliminated.\n\nThe algorithm was applied to JavaScript in Google Closure Tools and then to Dart in the dart2js compiler also written by Google, presented by Bob Nystrom in 2012[3][4] and described by the book "Dart in Action" by author Chris Buckett in 2013:\n\n    When code is converted from Dart to JavaScript the compiler does \'tree shaking\'. In JavaScript you have to add an entire library even if you only need it for one function, but thanks to tree shaking the Dart-derived JavaScript only includes the individual functions that you need from a library\n    — Chris Buckett\n\nThe next wave of popularity of the term is attributed to Rich Harris\'s Rollup project[5] developed in 2015.\nRelation to ECMAScript 6 modules\n\nThe popularity of tree shaking in JavaScript is based on the fact that in distinction from CommonJS modules, ECMAScript 6 module loading is static and thus the whole dependency tree can be deduced by statically parsing the syntax tree. Thus tree shaking becomes an easy problem. However, tree shaking does not only apply at the import/export level: it can also work at the statement level, depending on the implementation.[citation needed] ',

              "A clip from:\nhttps://www.katalon.com/resources-center/blog/ci-cd-introduction/\n\n\nCI/CD is the acronym for the combined practices of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). CI/CD practices are currently the most widely accepted choice to shorten software development and delivery cycle time.\n\n\nWhat is Continuous Integration?\n\nIn a CI practice, developers build, run, and test code on their own workstations before committing code to the version control repository. After changes are made to the repository, a chain of events is put into motion. A typical first step in this chain is to build the latest version of source code. If the build is successful, unit tests are executed. If unit testing succeeds, the build is deployed to test environments where system tests are performed (usually using automated tests). The team is notified about the status of this process, and a report is delivered to provide details, such as build number, defects, and the number of tests.\n\n\nWhat is Continuous Delivery?\n\nCD makes it possible to release builds to the production environment when needed. Allowing the team to deploy at will, CD effectively reduces time to market.\n\nBefore deploying software to production, the CD process includes performing automated system testing, unit testing (including API testing and load testing), and integration testing. The steps from CI to CD are usually completed automatically, including automated testing at the unit, integration, and system levels. As tests can fail at any level and environment, CI/CD must include a feedback channel to quickly report failures to developers.",

"I am a hard worker" followed up with how teammates always know, perhaps even commented, that we would get the job done and meet deadlines. Perhaps a bit about how some colleagues have become good friends. Maybe a little highlighting of how a boss liked to throw complicated or new things at us because he or she knew how well we can handle ourselves. This will all, of course, be personal and unique, but the general idea is just to showcase the positive affects that our personality, work ethic and passion have had on the people we worked with and the companies we worked for.\n\n\n',

              'This question is sometimes asked because it is more of an intermediate to advanced topic, given that it deals with both how things are layered, how an element\'s parent affects this and how the position property setting can change things.\n\n\tHere are the basics to know:\n\t- z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky).\n\n\t- Elements usually stack with the items that are lower in the DOM appearing on top. z-index can change that for an element using a integer. The higher the number, the higher it goes on the element stack.\n\n\t- Understanding how the parent-child relationship works is very important for understanding how z-index will affect the elements. If element A has children, but element B sits on top of it, then no child element A can ever be higher than element B. No matter how high we make the z-index setting. \n\n\t- You can animate z-index, but it is either behind or in front of an element. It will not transition from one to the other. \n\n\tAn example that can be dropped into an online editor like https://codepen.io/pen/ :\n\n\n\t\tCSS\n\t\t\tdiv {\n\t\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\t\tbackground: black;\n\t\t\tcolor: white;\n\t\t\twidth: 100%;\n\t\t\ttop: 35%;\n\t\t\ttext-align: center;\n\t\t\tpadding: 1em\n\t\t}\n\n\t\timg {\n\t\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\t\tleft: 25%;\n\t\t\ttop: 0;\n\t\t\tz-index: -1;\n\t\t\tmargin: 0 auto;\n\t\t}\n\n\n\t\tHTML\n\t\t    <div><h1>Toggle the image\'s z-index property to watch it go backwards and forwards.</h1>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random" width="50%">\n',

The use of this header is the best method to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Due to the difficulty in retrofitting CSP into existing websites, CSP is mandatory for all new websites and is strongly recommended for all existing high-risk sites.\n\nThe primary benefit of CSP comes from disabling the use of unsafe inline JavaScript. Inline JavaScript – either reflected or stored – means that improperly escaped user-inputs can generate code that is interpreted by the web browser as JavaScript. By using CSP to disable inline JavaScript, you can effectively eliminate almost all XSS attacks against your site.",

We need to articulate how strengths and be prepared for a reply that challenges this, perhaps like "Everyone does that...", or similar. This part of the interview is not really about our abilities with specific technologies, but more about how we make people around us better, how we have a strong positive impact on teams and how we will not just write the code that is needed, but use our passion, soft skills, and any other personal and professional traits to move projects and teams forward.

              'From Wikipedia.org:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing\n\nA/B testing (also known as bucket testing or split-run testing) is a user experience research methodology. [1] A/B tests consist of a randomized experiment with two variants, A and B.[2][3] It includes application of statistical hypothesis testing or "two-sample hypothesis testing" as used in the field of statistics. A/B testing is a way to compare two versions of a single variable, typically by testing a subject\'s response to variant A against variant B, and determining which of the two variants is more effective.[4] \n\n\nHere is a nice excerpt from this article:\nhttps://crossbrowsertesting.com/blog/visual-testing/ab-testing-screenshots/\n\n"One of the more common testing practices that marketers experiment with is A/B testing, which lets you test two scenarios at once to determine which your audience responds to better. This is done by having control and variable scenarios, which are randomly displayed to users when they visit your site.\n\nThese changes can be as small as testing the color of a CTA button to seeing whether adding a video on a landing page will increase registrations. For example, one user may see a green “Sign Up Now” button, while the other sees a red one. During an A/B test, you may look to see which one gets more clicks in order to inform which color you want to set the button to."\n\nA/B testing tools from a list complied in:\nhttps://www.ventureharbour.com/best-a-b-testing-tools/\n\nGoogle Analytics & Google Optimize - Free\nOptimizely\nVWO\nZoho PageSense\nHubSpot\nLeadformly\nUnbounce\nConvertize\nKameleoon\nConvert\n',

            answer:
              'A very complete answer from:\nhttps://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-create-a-multicolor-text-in-html-and-css.html\n\nYou can create a multicolor text with the help of image editors such as Pixelmator, Photoshop and so on. So, you can create a multicolor image and embed it into your website.\nThe multicolor text will not be searchable with this method.\n\nAs a result, your code will look like the following:\n\n<img src="multicolortext.png"/>\n\nMake separate elements¶\n\nAnother way is creating a text with separate elements by using the HTML <span> tag, which is an empty container. This means that you create a multicolor text by putting each letter in a separate element to define a different color for each letter of your text.\nExample of creating a multicolor text with separate elements in HTML:¶\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Title of the document</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <span style="color:#FF0000">H</span>\n    <span style="color:#66CC66">e</span>\n    <span style="color:#FF9966">l</span>\n    <span style="color:#FFCCCC">l</span>\n    <span style="color:#FF0066">o</span>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\nTry it Yourself »\nResult¶\nUse CSS¶\n\nAnd finally, you can use CSS. This is the easiest way of creating such kind of text.\n\nPut your text in a <span> tag and give it a class name "multicolortext". Then, you need the CSS background-image property to add a gradient background to your text with its "linear-gradient" value, where you put the names of your preferred colors.\n\nTo get multicolor text instead of the multicolor background, you need to use the background-clip property, which lets you control how far a background image or color extends beyond the element\'s padding or content. This step gives some colors to your text, but not exactly what you want.\n\nYou can get the final result by making your text color transparent with the color property so that the background color will be reflected in the text.\nExample of creating a multicolor text with HTML and CSS:¶\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>The title of the document</title>\n    <style>\n      .multicolortext {\n        background-image: linear-gradient(to left, violet, indigo, green, blue, yellow, orange, red);\n        -webkit-background-clip: text;\n        -moz-background-clip: text;\n        background-clip: text;\n        color: transparent;\n      }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>\n      <span class="multicolortext">Let’s be creative!</span>\n    </h1>\n  </body>\n</html>',

              'The "head" tag is a vital part of an HTML document, even though it does not get rendered to the DOM. The main purposes are to store external dependencies, like style sheets, JavaScript sheets and more, plus hold meta information like the page title & responsive information.\n\nHere is a basic sample head area:\n\n<head>\n\n<title>Name My Tab</title>\n\n    <meta name="author" content="Obi-Wan Kenobi">\n\n    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">\n\n    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./rule-property-value.css">\n\n    <script src="./anonymous-functions.js"></script>\n\n</head>\n\n\n',

              "This will always be asked, and it is a great opportunity for us to highlight our strengths and interests while getting insight into the company. \n\nThese questions can be anything and we definitely should ask about areas of concern or curiosity. In addition, below are some ideas to include.\n\nWhat code quality standards does the team follow? - This highlights that we care about code quality while giving us an idea of the company's focus.\n\n\tFollowing up this question based on their reply, we can ask:\n\t\t- What is the version control branching strategy..or do they use branches?\n\t\t- What kind of testing do they use? Unit tests? End-to-end tests?\n\t\t- Do they use any sort of feature-toggling?\n\t\t- Do they use continuous integration, continuous delivery or continuous deployment?\n\t\t\t(detail on those: https://tinyurl.com/ybty6fw3)\n\t\t- What is the QA process like?\n\nWhat project or team would I start on? - This shows we care about what we will be doing and who we will be doing it with. We can also see if the project interests us and, most importantly, if we are able to meet the team we are able to see if they seem happy. Even if only a a few names or the team lead's name is given, we might be able to do some research and find out about the people that might be our colleagues. \n\nWhy are you interested in hiring me? \n\n\t\t\t- OR -\n\nWhat are a few reasons you would hire me?\n\n\t- However it is asked, this is a good last question. The purpose is to get them thinking of why they would want to hire us. It also puts them on the spot to think about and say a few nice things about us. After the interview there will be a point when the decision makers will consider what they liked and what didn't grab them, but they will have already begun thinking about the good stuff before we even leave the room.\n\n\nThis last one is a statement instead of a question. We just got them thinking about why they would want to hire us, now we want to detail for them how we are perfect for this role.\n\n\tA few ideas for this:\n\t\t- Highlight the core technologies they use and our experience with them.\n\t\t- Our side projects and how we have continued learning.\n\t\t- Our passion for making teams work and helping other team members get better through solid communication, being calm and positive, mentoring when needed and keeping focused on solutions and goals instead of disagreements.\n\t\t- Anything that we feel we offer and, especially, what sets us apart. This is our final chance to sell ourselves. We need to make it count.",

This is an opportunity to drive home areas where the companies and our interests mesh nicely. In addition, knowing how we want to be better just one year from now can show a commitment to constant growth.\n- Give a brief outline of what your ideal professional self would be five years from now. Make it real and doable, but still a bit of a long reach. Unrealistic goals or extremely small goals are not going to help us look any better. High, but achievable, goals can be inspiring.\n- The five-year goals can include:\n\t\t- A higher understanding of certain principles.\n\t\t- More experience and deeper knowledge in one or two technologies (ideally ones that are associated with the job being considered).\n\t\t- A general increased role and professional status, like becoming a senior dev, leading a team or even entering into management.\n\t\t- One or two new languages, tools or processes that would build on the current ones (ideally meshing with what the company offers, if possible).\n\t\t- Certain experience within a team or some similar goal that relates to being even better working with others.\n\t\t- Conferences, talks, meetups, projects related to career path, etc.\n- Give a brief outline of what your ideal personal self would be five years from now. This can be anything at all and should definitely be genuine. Family life, personal project (writing a book, starting a group, etc), growing hobbies or adding new ones, physical fitness, etc.",

              "It is not necessary to know them all, but more to show a depth of understanding and familiarity with using a few. Adding to this with third-party API's experience, like the Braintree API, or Slack API, can help showcase real-world experience.\n\n\n\nA few options are:\n\t- Geolocations\n\n\t\t        if (navigator.geolocation) {\n\t\t            navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((pos) => {\n\t\t                console.log('Got Location', pos);\n\t\t            }, () => {\n\t\t                console.log('nope')\n\t\t            });\n\t\t        }\n\n\n\n- Media API: This API works for both audio and video. There are a number of methods including play() and pause() as well as load().\n\n- Text Track API: Picking up where the Media API leaves off, the Text Track API allows us to interact with text tracks (subtitles or captions) for the audio and videos.\n\n- Drag and Drop: There are a number of possibilities with this API. Among these, you can add  'draggable' attribute to allow a user to move an element then have event handlers in place on a drop zone so the browser knows where the element can be dropped.\n\n- History API: This spec gives developers more control of the user's browser session. Along with moving the the user forward or backward, we can check the length of the history and even add or remove entries. We can hold data enabling us to restore a page or just update the URL without refreshing the page.\n",

              'Accessibility has become a very big focus for many companies. Knowing they are hiring people that can support this effort is important. The goal for an answer to any question about accessibility is to show that we have a basic understanding combined with being able to about real-world use.\n\nAccessibility is no longer just something nice to incorporate, it is essential for making sure people, best practices and, in some cases, laws are being respected. \n\nA few accessibility features we can incorporate:\n\nThoughtful contrasting colors for people who have trouble seeing color. This allows them to see a difference between two colored areas.\n\nAria labels are important for signalling correct detail to screen readers.\n\nUsing tags instead of CSS properties, like <em> instead of font-weight, will signal to screen-readers the intent to emphasis. This can then be past along to the user.\nThere are tools available, like Lighthouse now included in Chrome Dev Tools, that can run scans and alert us to accessibility concerns.\n\n\nHere is an example of the <em> and an aria label:\n\n\n    <p>Hi my name is Sheev Palpatine, but you can call me <em>EMPORER DARTH SIDIOUS</em></p>\n\n    <button aria-label="Close Modal">Close</button>',

HTTP2 adds a number of features to manage the streams, but leaves old semantics untouched.\n\n\nHTTP/2 supports queries multiplexing, headers compression, priority and more intelligent packet streaming management.

It is important to separate concerns for multi-faceted projects like web pages.\n\n\t<h1 style="color: blue;">Example</h1>\n\n- <style> tags in the documents <head> can be used to assign selectors to declarations. The browser will then link classes used on the elements in the <body> to the selectors in the <style> tag.

We just need to give a brief reasoning that includes our thoughts surrounding big moves, our steps to work with our current employer before making th e moves and how those decisions ended up being good or, perhaps, lessons that we learned from those that did not.\n\nUltimately, we don't want to lie or give the impression we are trying to cover anything up.

              "This question is designed to see our thought process on this issue.\n\nHere are some basic steps for approaching a slow app:\n\n\t1. Define the specific problem. What, specifically is slow? Is the initial load slow? Are page transitions slow? Do the interactions, like menu animations, seem slow or choppy? Does this occur on only some browsers or devices? \n\n\t\tUltimately, the goal here is to get as clear a picture as possible as of each part that is slow. This enables us to find the best spots to begin drilling down.\n\n\t2. Narrow the scope: Next we want to take our drill-down points and begin to narrow each of those to as small a piece of code as we can. \n\n\t\tFor instance, if the issue is slow loading, a good place to start is either Chrome Dev Tools' Lighthouse tool or a page speed analyzer. One popular one is: \n\n\t\thttps://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/\n\n\t\tThese tools can help see where it is slow, like the first paint or how long until a user can actually interact with the page. From there it can help us pinpoint potential problem areas, like large images or slow server response.\n\n\t\tin a browser's dev tools we can use other tools, like the Network section to see detail on specific items like when they loaded, how long they took and if they were blocking progress. \n\n\t\tIf the issue is something not related to resources loading, dev tools can help narrow down the search using the Debugger, Performance, Inspector, Console and others. \n\n\t3. Isolate: Once we gained an understanding of the specific symptoms and then narrowed the scope of our attention, we can now address these specific areas of code. Dev tools Debugger can be great for stepping through JavaScript. The Performance tool can help see how an animation affects the page processing. \n\n\t\tIf need be, it can help to isolate specific blocks of code in a separate editor, perhaps even an online editor like repl.it, codepen.io or jsbin.com. This can help zero-in on specific problems in the code.\n\t\tAlong the same line of thinking, commenting out blocks of code and/or temporarily inserting new simplified code can help ensure we have properly identified the problem area.\n\n\t4. Fix: By this point, we have arrived at the problem pieces of code. Now, we just need to correct the issue.\n\n\t5. Test...a lot: We have not fixed the problem at this point. We have only written the code that we think will correct the issue. Test. Test. Test then take a break...test again. At that point, we have fixed teh issue.",

              'There are a wide array of strategies for this answer. Below are a few basic approaches, though a web search (click the "More About this Question" button for that) will yield a wealth of detail and other options.\n\n- We can just give an amount we would like to make and we think we are worth. it is simple and direct, though it might be a factor in eliminating us from the candidate list if the number far exceeds what the company wants to spend on the position or thinks we are worth. This approach is not concerned with staying in market value. It is more about weeding out companies that can not or do not wish to pay what we value our services at. \n\n- We can take our current salary and just raise that a little. Assuming we are applying for a similar position, or even slightly elevated, this keeps us around market range. \n\n- If the job is meant to be an entry into a new career, pushing for more money might hurt the greater purpose. We might want to consider looking for the salary range listed in the job post and speaking to an amount towards the middle, with a minimum around the listed minimum. Or, perhaps, if our situation is one where little more or less would not matter and getting in the door is the focus, being honest about this can be OK. It would be best to also ask how soon someone is eligible for a raise and to make sure they do not offer below their posted minimum. There are some who would say never ask for or imply the offered minimum, but getting the first foot in can make a tremendous difference and then enable us to make the next interview about what we are really worth.\n\n- Use online tools to find a market salary range and then ask for a salary somewhere between the average and the top salary depending on where our skills and experience put us.\n\n\n\tA few tools for finding market value:\n\n\t\tGlassDoor: https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/index.htm\n\t\tPayScale: https://www.payscale.com/my/survey/choose\n\t\tLinkedin Salary Tool: https://www.linkedin.com/salary/',

            answer:
              'This answer comes from:\nhttps://resource-centre.net/html5-tutorials/bullet-point-lists/\n\nBullet Point Lists (or Unordered Lists)\n\nThe first kind of list we will look at is using bullets.\nUnordered List – the <ul> Tag\n\nBullet point lists are also known as unordered lists (UL) because there is no numbering involved. That is why a bulleted list uses the <ul> </ul> tag pair. Here is a basic example:\n\nThe whole list is surrounded by <ul> </ul> for a start. When you open your list tag, make sure you automatically type your closing tag and then proceed to fill your items between them.\nThe type Attribute\n\nThe type attribute determines what kind of bullet you are seeing on the page. Although through CSS you can specify a wide-range of bullet styles, and even use your own image, in raw HTML it is best to stick with the common types which are\n\n    type="circle" – an unfilled circle\n\n    type="disc" – a filled circle\n\n    type="square" – a filled square\n\nList Items – the <li> Tag\n\nEach individual item in your list is wrapped in its own <li> </li> tag pair. You can often get away without the </li> but I would recommend keeping it in, just so you maintain healthy coding habit.\n\nThe list above I placed in individual <ul> but each <li> also supports the type attribute, such that I could create\n\n    Square\n    Disc\n    Circle\n\nNot sure why you would want to do that, but you can if you want to!\n\nBullet List Indentation\n\nBefore you apply any CSS to your list, HTML (or more accurately, your browser) will apply indentation to your list, so it stands out from your normal paragraph <p> tags.\nOrdered / Numbered Lists – the <ol> Tag\n\nIf you want to present your list in an ordered fashion, then the <ol> tag is your friend. By default this will give you a numbered list, but the type attribute gives you flexibility, in the same way as bullet point lists do.\n\nwhich outputs\n\n    Item 1\n    Item 2\n    Item 3\n\nThe type attribute offers a few more options in ordered lists compared to bulleted ones. A bit more guidance on this can be obtained at W3Schools.\nStarting an Ordered List On A Different Number\n\nSay you were putting together some instructions to build a table. You may want to use a numbered list to achieve this. However, if you wanted to put images and extra text between each stage, you would probably need multiple lists. The problem is that each list starts at number 1 (or letter A) by default. That would screw up your instructions!\n\nThankfully HTML has the start property to allow you to start on a subsequent number:\n\nThis outputs:\n\n    Step Four\n    Step Five\n    Step Six\n\nReversing The Order\n\nIf you want to show your numbers (or letters) in reverse order, then this is really easy too. You might want to do a ‘Top 10’ with your best item announced last, for example. This can be done by adding the word reversed into your Ordered List opening tag:\n\nAnd this would make your list look like this:\n\n    First LI\n    Second LI\n    Third LI\n    Fourth LI\n    Fifth LI\n\nMulti-Level Bullet List in HTML\n\nWith patchy browser support (and sometimes undone by CSS in some sites) you can create a multilevel list. This is achieved by embedding one list inside another:\n\nWhich creates:\n\n    Top Level Item\n        Sub-Item 1\n        Sub-Item 2\n    Top Level Item\n\nYou can use a combination of <ul> and <ol>. That may be useful if you want bullet points under a numbered list.\n\n    Top Level Item\n        Sub-Item 1\n        Sub-Item 2\n    Top Level Item\n',

Overall, we want to exhibit good communication skills, and a brief bit about how important we think communication skills are when working with teams, or our superiors, the client, etc can help. Perhaps even a story about a time when kept our calm when others did not, or an example of how we set aside things that bothered us, and were able to generate harmony that helped move a project forward. All of this needs to be delivered, like all of our answers, with good eye contact without staring, enthusiasm married with a calm and thoughtful approach and general good will and respectful manner. These qualities can mean a lot to a company and can raise our profile above others in the eyes of the interviewer.\n",

              'The following excerpt come from bitofco.de:\nhttps://bitsofco.de/understanding-the-virtual-dom/\n\nWhy do we need a virtual DOM?\n\nTo understand why the concept of the virtual DOM arose, let’s revisit the original DOM. As I mentioned, there are two parts to the DOM - the object-based representation of the HTML document and the API to manipulating that object.\n\nFor example, let’s take this simple HTML document with an unordered list and one list item.\n\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang="en">\n <head></head>\n <body>\n    <ul class="list">\n        <li class="list__item">List item</li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\n\nThis document can be represented as the following DOM tree:\n\nhtml\nhead lang="en"\nbody\nul class="list"\nli class="list__item"\n"List item"\n\nLet’s say we want to modify the content of the first list item to \n"List item one"\n and also add a second list item. To do this, we will need use the DOM APIs to find the elements we want to update, create the new elements, add attributes and content, then finally update the DOM elements themselves.\n\nconst listItemOne = document.getElementsByClassName("list__item")[0];\nlistItemOne.textContent = "List item one";\n\nconst list = document.getElementsByClassName("list")[0];\nconst listItemTwo = document.createElement("li");\nlistItemTwo.classList.add("list__item");\nlistItemTwo.textContent = "List item two";\nlist.appendChild(listItemTwo);\n\nThe DOM wasn’t made for this…\n\nWhen the first specification for the DOM was released in 1998, we built and managed web pages in very differently. There was far less reliance on the DOM APIs to create and update the page content as frequently as we do today.\n\nSimple methods such as \ndocument.getElementsByClassName()\n are fine to use on a small scale, but if we are updating multiple elements on a page every few seconds, it can start to become really expensive to constantly query and update the DOM.\n\nEven further, because of the way the APIs are setup, it is usually simpler to perform more expensive operations where we update larger parts of the document than to find and update the specific elements. Going back to our list example, it is in some ways easier to replace the entire unordered list with a new one than to modify the specific elements.\n\nconst list = document.getElementsByClassName("list")[0];\nlist.innerHTML = `\n<li class="list__item">List item one</li>\n<li class="list__item">List item two</li>\n`;\n\n\nIn this particular example, the performance difference between the methods is probably insignificant. However, as the size of the web page grows, it becomes more important to only select and update what is needed.\n\n… but the virtual DOM was!\n\nThe virtual DOM was created to solve these problems of needing to frequently update the DOM in a more performant way. Unlike the DOM or the shadow DOM, the virtual DOM isn\'t an official specification, but rather a new method of interfacing with the DOM.\n\nA virtual DOM can be thought of as a copy of the original DOM. This copy can be frequently manipulated and updated, without using the DOM APIs. Once all the updates have been made to the virtual DOM, we can look at what specific changes need to be made to the original DOM and make them in a targetted and optimised way.',

            answer:
              'Meta tags are used in an HTML document to provide detail about the specific document. This could be to provide context, like to credit the page author, or detail for search engine optimization (SEO), or any info that can be helpful to pass along, but does not belong in the content of the rendered page. This information can be minor detail or even to instruct the browser to treat the document differently, like on the "viewport" settings to make a page responsive or "refresh" to have the page refresh at a certain interval.\n\nHere are a few  meta info samples:\n\n    <meta chartset="UTF-8">\n\n    <meta description="Meta Tag Example">\n\n    <meta keywords="html, head, meta, tags">\n\n    <meta author="Ben Solo">\n\n    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">\n\n    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">',

            answer:
              "Questions about components can usually be answered either generally or specific to a framework, if we choose. We just need to demonstrate an understanding of the core concepts.\n\nThere have been the addition of web components native to the browser. modern frameworks have already had components built in for a while.\n\nA component will usually have an HTML template that we can pass in properties or other data. This allows us to build a component once and then use it multiple times. \n\nCommon uses are a navigation menu or model or buttons. These components can really be anything that we might want to use multiple times.\n\nEach component is encapsulated to ensure internal code will not collide with any document they are used in.\n\n\n\nWeb Component example from MDN (frameworks' syntax can be different):\n\nThis would be in a word-count.js file:\n\n// Create a class for the element\nclass WordCount extends HTMLParagraphElement {\n  constructor() {\n    // Always call super first in constructor\n    super();\n\n    // count words in element's parent element\n    const wcParent = this.parentNode;\n\n    function countWords(node){\n      const text = node.innerText || node.textContent;\n      return text.split(/\\s+/g).length;\n    }\n\n    const count = `Words: ${countWords(wcParent)}`;\n\n    // Create a shadow root\n    const shadow = this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});\n\n    // Create text node and add word count to it\n    const text = document.createElement('span');\n    text.textContent = count;\n\n    // Append it to the shadow root\n    shadow.appendChild(text);\n\n    // Update count when element content changes\n    setInterval(function() {\n      const count = `Words: ${countWords(wcParent)}`;\n      text.textContent = count;\n    }, 200);\n  }\n}\n\n// Define the new element\ncustomElements.define('word-count', WordCount, { extends: 'p' });\n\n\n\nHere is how to use it in a document:\n<script src=\"word-count.js\"></script>\n<p is=\"word-count\"></p>",

In the common case of HTML, the rendering engine parses HTML and CSS, and displays the parsed content on the screen.\n\n    Networking: network calls such as HTTP requests, using different implementations for different platform behind a platform-independent interface.\n\n    UI backend: This exposes a generic interface that is not platform specific. Underneath it uses operating system user interface methods all for drawing basic items like combo boxes and windows. \n\n    JavaScript interpreter: Used to parse and execute JavaScript code.\n\n    Data storage: The browser may need to save all sorts of data locally, such as cookies. Browsers also support storage mechanisms such as localStorage, IndexedDB, WebSQL and FileSystem.\n\nThe flow:\n\n           | <--------  USER INTERFACE\t\t\t\t________\nUI BACKEND |\t                 V\t\t\t\t\t     DATA\n           |            BROWSER ENGINE --------->  STORAGE\n           |                  V\t\t\t\t       ---------\n           | <------   RENDERING ENGINE\n                         V\t        V\t        \t\n                  NETWORKING   JAVASCRIPT INTERPRETER    \n",

              "This very basic question should prompt an easy and basic answer.  We just need to show we understand the general process.\n\n- We initiate a request using the domain name system with the URL as an address. \n- The server that houses the address will be located via the internet and the request is made.\n- The server then serves up the requested data.\n- The data is transferred via the web back to the browser.\n- \t\n\n\n- The web browser that you are using will contact a DNS (Domain Name System) server.\n- The DNS will translate the website name into a numeric IP address (every website domain name is basically an alias for an IP address). \n- The IP address is sent to the browser.\n- The browser uses this IP address to locate the server hosting the web page and, using the TCP protocol, opens a connection via port 80 on the server. In some cases, authentication can be part of this connection. This might be a JSON web token, or some other data, included in the request.\n- The server will then send the requested data to the browser.\n- The browser will then render the page to the screen. \n\n- The new web page might include dependencies, like CSS ot JavaScript sheets, or images, etc. The browser will then either request these via the same connection, or, if the begin the process for a new connection to retrieve each item.\n\n- Once the browser page (tab or window) is closed, the connection to the server ends.\n\n",

              "Links can be created using the <a> tag, with referencing through the use of the number (#) symbol. For example, you can have one line as <a href=”#topmost”>BACK TO TOP</a>, which would result in the words “BACK TO TOP” appearing on the webpage and links to a bookmark named topmost. You then create a separate tag command like <a name=”topmost”> somewhere on the top of the same webpage so that the user will be linked to that spot when he clicked on “BACK TO TOP”.",

              "This type of question is designed to see both our view on dealing with workplace conflict, but also how you approach the question. Our goal is to show that we not only have dealt with conflict but that we have thought about it and worked through the difficult aspects. The worst thing we can do is not have an answer, or say we have never encountered any conflict. That is not realistic and it leaves the question wide open as to what they can expect from us if we encounter conflict while working there. Even a story about how we handled conflict poorly is fine, as long as we can talk clearly about how we thought and felt at the time and how we eventually learned how to handle it all better. \n\nTo put it simply:\n\tBe human. \n\tShow growth. \n\tShow thought. \n\tShow intent to understand others, even if they are acting poorly. \n\tShow a desire to explore the finer points of human interaction.\n\tShow that all of the above maters enough to have carefully thought about it.\n",

Led by Web inventor and Director Tim Berners-Lee and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe, W3C\'s mission is to lead the Web to its full potential.\n\n\nWhat does W3C do?\n\nW3C\'s primary activity is to develop protocols and guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the Web. W3C\'s standards define key parts of what makes the World Wide Web work. Learn more about W3C\'s mission.\nWhere is W3C located?\n\nW3C does not have a single physical headquarters. There are four institutions, however, that "host" W3C: MIT (in Cambridge, MA, USA), ERCIM (in Sophia-Antipolis, France), Keio University (near Tokyo, Japan), and Beihang University (in Beijing, China).\n\nThe W3C staff is distributed around the world, but there are concentrations of people in Cambridge, Massachusetts (USA), Sophia-Antipolis (France), and Tokyo (Japan). In addition, W3C is represented in 17 other regions of the world via representatives based at organizations. W3C calls these regional points of contact "W3C Offices."\nHow is W3C funded?\n\nW3C receives funds from:\n\n    W3C Member dues\n    Research grants and other sources of private and public funding\n    Individual donations of money and equipment \n\nWhat is the difference between the Web and the Internet?\n\nFrom the definition in the Wikipedia: "The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that interchange data by packet switching using the standardized Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)."\n\nThus, the Internet is a network of networks, defined by the TPC/IP standards.\n\nThe Web, on the other hand, is defined in W3C\'s Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume I as follows: "The World Wide Web (WWW, or simply Web) is an information space in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI)."\n\nThus, the Web is an information space.

              "What is async, defer, preload and prefetch for loading JavaScript documents",
            answer:
              'All of this addresses the loading of documents and how they affect the main document.\n\nFrom:https://javascript.info/script-async-defer\n\n\nDEFER:\n\nThe defer attribute tells the browser not to wait for \nthe script. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, \nbuild DOM. The script loads “in the background”, and then runs when the \nDOM is fully built.\n\nHere’s the same example with defer:\n<p>...content before script...</p>\n\n<scrip/t defer src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js?speed=1"></scrip/t>\n\n<!-- visible immediately -->\n<p>...content after script...</p>\n\n\nIn other words:\n\n    - Scripts with defer never block the page.\n    - Scripts with defer always execute when the DOM is ready (but before DOMContentLoaded event).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASYNC\n\nThe async attribute is somewhat like \ndefer. It also makes the script non-blocking. But it has important differences in the behavior.\n\nThe async attribute means that a script is completely independent:\n\n    - The browser doesn’t block on async scripts (like defer).\n    - Other scripts don’t wait for async scripts, and async scripts don’t wait for them.\n    - DOMContentLoaded and async scripts don’t wait for each other:\n        | DOMContentLoaded may happen both before an async script (if an async script finishes loading after the page is complete)\n        | …or after an async script (if an async script is short or was in HTTP-cache)\n\n    <p>...content before scripts...</p>\n\n    <scrip/t>\n      document.addEventListener(\'DOMContentLoaded\', () => alert("DOM ready!"));\n    </scrip/t>\n\n    <scrip/t async src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js"></scrip/t>\n    <scrip/t async src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/small.js"></scrip/t>\n\n    <p>...content after scripts...</p>\n\n\n\nThe following examples come from: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/html-preload-prefetch\n\n\n    \nPRELOAD\n\nPreloading JavaScript resources is done differently. This example, taken from this Google Developers article on preloading, shows this:\nindex.html\n\n<link rel="preload" href="used-later.js" as="scrip/t">\n<!-- ... -->\n<scrip/t>\n  var usedLaterScript = document.createElement(\'script\');\n  usedLaterScript.src = \'used-later.js\';\n  document.body.appendChild(usedLaterScript);\n</scrip/t>\n\n\n\nPREFETCH\n\nPrefetching works similarly to preloading. The difference is that, \nwhen prefetching a resource, the browser considers the resource to be \nlow priority. This means that the resource or asset will load a bit \nlater. Because of this, prefetching is usually implemented with \nresources that are not required initially, but are used at a later \npoint.\n\nTo implement prefectching in your HTML page, change the value of \nrel to "prefetching.\n\nindex.html\n<link\n  rel="prefetch"\n  as="style"\n  onload="this.rel = \'stylesheet\'"\n  href=\'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:100,900|Material+Icons\'>\n',

              'This is generally asked to get an idea of how much someone pays attention to good practices and, ultimately, will write easier to understand code and have an easier time jumping into someone else\'s code.\n\nGeneral naming conventions:\n-\tNames should be brief, but descriptive enough that the average non-developer could understand. For example, using "d = new Date()" might serve brevity, but can make no sense later in the program and require extra effort to understand. Conversely, "theDateForTheDayTheAppIsRun = new Date()" is clear, but unnecessarily long. Simply "todaysDate = new Date()" is brief and easily understood.\n\nA few JavaScript examples can be:\n- Camel case for variables: const lastName = \'Kenobi\'\n- Pascal case for classes: class MainCharacter { }\n- "is" or "has" prefix for booleans.\n- Function calls that will be returning something can start with have a descriptive verb ("update", "get", etc).\n- As few variables as possible. This is not really a naming convention, but it greatly affects the abilty for the names of the variables that do get used to be easier to follow and keep track of.\n- Do not re-use variable names.\n- In many cases it is better not to make a variable equal itself with modification. This can be difficult to follow through and can often be better served with a new, variable descriptively named to match the newly formed data.\n- When reasonable, if a specific item in an array is being used, assign a more descriptive variable: const updatedFileId = changes[0]\n- Property names that do not need to be prefixed with the class name. \n\tWe do not need: class Car {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructor(brand, purchaseDate) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.carName = brand;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.carYear = purchaseDate;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n} \n\tInstead, we can use: class Car {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructor(brand) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.name = brand;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.year = purchaseDate;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t} \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t// in use it will still be descriptive\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconst myCar = new Car();\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmyCar,name = \'Jeep\';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmyCar.year = \'2017\';\n- Avoid "magic" numbers, or numbers without a name, when possible. \n\tWe want to avoid: const forwardMovement = duration * 3;\n\tWe can use: const rate = 3;\n\t\t\t\t  forwardMovement = duration * rate;\n\t\t\t\t \n\nCSS & HTML examples:\n- Use nicely cascading rules to make for as few selectors as possible.\n- Kabab case for selectors: .inner-wrap\n- Descriptive selector names. This can be the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) method or similar.\n- Try to avoid using the same name for an ID and a class. These are technically independent from each other, but this can cause confusion for a developer.\n',

In an object literal, the spread syntax enumerates the properties of an object and adds the key-value pairs to the object being created.\n\nSpread syntax looks exactly like rest syntax. In a way, spread syntax is the opposite of rest syntax. Spread syntax "expands" an array into its elements, while rest syntax collects multiple elements and "condenses" them into a single element.

            answer:
              'This might sound like a silly question, but questions like this sometimes are used to get us to show our understanding of basic, but often needed, aspects of CSS. This will usually be a screening question, so a descriptive verbal outline will needed, not actual code.\n\nTo begin, we need to target our element via ID, or by class for multiple elements. We then want to set an equal width and height, perhaps 100px each. From there, we can either set the border for a few pixels or a background color or even both. This way we can see it. At that point, we have a square.\n\nMaking that square a circle simply requires a border-radius of 50% all of the way around. \n\nNow, that is a fixed width square or circle. We could make it responsive by using a percentage as the width and an equal percentage as padding-bottom. If there is content in the square or circle, one way to keep the sides equal would be to absolutely position the content. Ultimately, this is just an option. There are many ways to approach graphics in CSS, and purpose and the rest of the document will play into a plan for making the graphics responsive.\n\n\nPaste this example into an online editor, like https://codepen.io/pen/, to see the square and circle:\n\n\tCSS\n\t\t.square {\n\t\t\tbackground: lightgreen;\n\t\t\twidth: 50%;\n\t\t\tpadding-bottom: 50%;\n\t\t\tmargin: 0 auto;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t.square.circle {\n\t\t\tborder-radius: 50%;\n\t\t\tbackground: salmon;\n\t\t}\n\n\tHTML\n\t\t<div class="square"></div>\n\n\t\t<div class="square circle"></div>',

            answer:
              "The days of great consideration being paid to Internet Explorer's many differences will, or possibly have, come to an end. This does not mean browser compatibility is no longer a concern. \nModern browsers are much more consistent with including features, but it is still good to check with a tool like https://caniuse.com/ or MDN to make sure new features are well covered.\n\nFor most browsers, we can easily download them and test our app. But what about older versions of each browser? What about these browsers on different devices. What if we need to test on Safari, but do not have access to a Mac? There are tools like https://www.browserstack.com/ to test web apps in many different ways. Some will even monitor real users on different browsers and devices. We can even have automated routines to test these scenarios.  \n\nBeyond testing, it is important that we know well what our target audience is going to be. If it is truly a global reach we are seeking, we need to consider things like Opera Mini (popular in parts of the world with slow internet), Baidu (a popular China-based browser), KaiOS' browser (mobile OS and browser used all over and especially in India) and any others that are used.\n\nAll of this does not mean that wide-reach intentions mean we need to remove most of our JavaScript just to make the app work right on Opera Mini. It just means just that we need to consider what happens to our product for the those users and work towards good solutions. \n\nWhithin any app, we should pay attention to current browser compatibility and utilize thinking along these lines:\n\n\t- We might just need to ensure there are fullbacks in place.\n\n\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\tposition: sticky; // Not fully supported by some browsers\n\n\t- We can plan our interactions and layouts so that nothing critical relies on technology not fully supported.\t\n\n\t- We can check for specific feature support in a browser and have separate functionality ready. This is not ideal as it requires extra consideration when maintaining the web app, but it is a workable solution.\n\n\t- We and the customer can consider the costs vs the gains related to supporting certain browsers. The benefits might not offset the costs of supporting a specific browser's use and/or the areas of the world it is popular.",

              'Some browsers accept additional proprietary non-standard non-css syntax on top of the usual css. Less is build on top of standard css and therefore may not recognize it. You may also need to put an otherwise non-parseable value inside a variable and use it to dynamically build selector or other css part during compilation time.\n\nEscaping allows you to use any arbitrary string as property or variable value. It can be used also to dynamically build selectors, but that feature is deprecated and replaced by different more powerful option.\n\nSyntax\n\nUse either ~"whatever" or ~\'whatever\' syntax to escape property values. Anything between quotes is used as is with almost no changes. The "as is" rule has one exception: string interpolation works with the usual @{variableName} syntax.\n\nUsed as Property Value\n\nSample input:\n\n@variable: "dynamic";\nh1 {\n  margin: 1 ~"2 2" 3;\n  padding: ~\'ms:special.syntax()\';\n  text: ~\'@{variable}\'; //interpolation works\n}\n\ncompiles into:\n\nh1 {\n  margin: 1 2 2 3;\n  padding: ms:special.syntax();\n  text: dynamic;\n}\n\n',

              "Excerpts from hacker.io:\n\nCSS was originally released in 1996 and consists of properties for adding font properties such as typeface and emphasis color of text, backgrounds, and other elements. CSS2 was released in 1998 with added styles for other media types so that it can be used for page layout designing. CSS3 was released in 1999 and presentation-style properties were added in it that allows you to build a presentation from documents.\n\nUnlike CSS2, which was comprised of a single document, CSS3 has its specifications divided into many individual modules, which makes CSS3 a whole lot easier to handle.\n\nWith CSS3, the designers can now use special fonts, like those available in Google Fonts and Typecast. Earlier, with CSS and CSS2, designers could only use “web-safe fonts” for being 100% sure to use fonts that would always display the same on every machine.\n\nWhile CSS and CSS2 had ‘simple selectors’, CSS3 calls the components as ‘a sequence of simple selectors’.\n\nCSS3 came up with some key web design considerations like rounded borders that help in rounding up the borders without any hassle. This turned out to be a huge plus point for developers who were struggling with initial versions of CSS borders.\n\nCSS3 has the capability to split text sections into multiple columns so that it can be read like a newspaper. In CSS2, the developers had difficulty because the standard was not equipped with automatically breaking the text so that it fits within a box.\n\n",

              'Synchronous code runs from top to bottom in order. One line, command, function, etc is processed and resolved before moving to the next. This can be problematic if you encounter "blocking" code, which is code that causes processing one item for a longer amount of time. This means the rest of the program (and end user) wait until the program can mover on to the next line. This is where asynchronous code can be helpful.\n\nAsynchronous code runs separately from other code. This means it can take longer to process without "blocking" the rest of the program from running. In JavaScript, the Call Stack processes code synchronously. If a piece of asynchronous code is encountered, it is moved out of the Call Stack. If it is part of a Web API, like setTimeOut(), then the browser handles the resolving the code. Otherwise, it is moved to the Callback Que. In either case, the Event Loop will take the next item that has resolved, and place it on the Call Stack. This time, when the code can be dealt with in order because it is ready and will not block the processing the rest of the program.',

A positive shape automatically creates a negative shape.    \n\n\nDIRECTION – All lines have direction – Horizontal, Vertical or Oblique. Horizontal suggests calmness, stability and tranquility. Vertical gives a feeling of balance, formality and alertness. Oblique suggests movement and action    \n\n\nSIZE – Size is simply the relationship of the area occupied by one shape to that of another.    \n\n\nTEXTURE – Texture is the surface quality of a shape – rough, smooth, soft hard glossy etc.    \n\n\nCOLOR – Color is light reflected off objects. Color has three main characteristics: hue or its name (red, green, blue, etc.), value (how light or dark it is), and intensity (how bright or dull it is).",

            answer:
              "Closure is an inner function, that is accessible outside of its parent function's scope while maintaining its connection to the parent's variables and other data. This can be don to keep some data private and purposely expose other data.\nTo accomplish this, an anonymous function can be immediately invoked. In this function, data we wish to keep  private can be processed. Usually this data would be removed from memory via JavaScript's \"garbage collection\" memory clearing process. If this function returns a function, let's call it a child function, that accesses data from the parent function, the parent's data will remain in memory. In this situation, the only access to the parent function's data will be via whatever had been set up in the child function. In addition, every time the child function is invoked, a new function scope is created for the child function. The parent function scope is only created once. This means that we can invoke the child function to change a variable in the parent and the next time we invoke the child function the variable in the parent will still reflect the change. \n\nThis can be considered state management and might not be as useful today given other options to manage state. Still, this process can be used to protect sensitive data or even just a to keep a counter variable from being accidentally increased.\n\nSome examples\n// For comparison, this is a counter without closure\nlet counter = 0;\n\nfunction add1 () {\n\tcounter++;\n\treturn counter;\n}\n\nconsole.log(add1());  // 1\nconsole.log(add1());  // 2\n// The counter becomes unpredictable when it can be altered elswhere\ncounter++;\nconsole.log(add1());  // 4\n\n\n// This is a counter with closure\nconst add1 = (function () {\n  let counter = 0;\n\n  return function () {\n\tcounter++;\n\treturn counter;\n  };\n})();\nconsole.log(add1());  // 1\nconsole.log(add1());  // 2\nconsole.log(add1());  // 3\ncounter++;// error: counter is not defined\nconsole.log(add1());\n\n// Another, more complex example\n// In this travelAgent() in the child function made available, while \n// the \"trip\" variable and agent() function are accessible through \n// travelAgent(). The book() function, is only accessible through agent().\nfunction vacation() {\n\tvar trip;\n\n\tfunction travelAgent(itinerary) {\n\t\tagent(itinerary);\n\t\treturn trip;\n\t}\n\n\tfunction agent(itinerary) {\n\t\tif (itinerary === 'Orlando') {\n\t\t\ttrip = ['Orlando', 'Disney', 'Universal'];\n\t\t\tbook();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tfunction book() {\n\t\ttrip.push('booked');\n\t}\n\treturn travelAgent;\n}\n\nvar myVacation = vacation();\n\nconsole.log(myVacation('Orlando'));\n\n// Array [ \"Orlando\", \"Disney\", \"Universal\", \"booked\" ]\n",

A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.\n\nO - Open-closed principle. Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.\n\nL - Liskov substitution principle. Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.\n\nI - Interface segregation principle. A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.\n\nD - Dependency Inversion Principle. Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.\n\nHere is a good article on the subject: https://dev.to/francescoxx/solid-principles-in-javascript-3pek\n",

So, it is easy for designers and developers to work more efficiently and quickly.\n    It is compatible with all versions of CSS. So, you can use any available CSS libraries.\n    It provides nesting so you can use nested syntax and useful functions like color manipulation, math functions and other values.\n\nDisadvantages\n\n    The developer must have enough time to learn new features present in this preprocessor before using it.\n    Using Sass may result in the loss of some benefits of a browser's built-in element inspector.",

              "This addresses what happens when passing data from one variable to another. More specifically, this is about where variables point. \n\nThe original variable points to a place in memory. The new variable can either point to the same place in memory, which means the reference to the data was passed, or the new variable can point to a new place in memory that contains the same data, which means the values were passed to the new memory location.\n\nThe main reason this is important is shown by the results of changing either variable. If only a reference was passed, meaning both variables point to the same data at the same memory location, then changing a value will change change it for both variables, as well as any others pointing to the same place in memory.\n\nIf the actual values were passed and reside at a new location in memory, changing the values at the new memory location will only be visible with the new variable (and any others pointing to that location). The original variable is still pointing at the old memory location and remains unchanged.\n\nExamples:\nlet example1 = 1;\nlet example2 = example1;\nexample2++;\n\nconsole.log(example1, ' - ', example2);\n\nconst example3 = {\n  weapon: 'lightsaber'\n};\nconst example4 = {\n  ...example3\n};\nexample4.name = 'Darth Vader';\nconsole.log(example3, ' - ', example4);",

It is positioned relative to the initial containing block established by the viewport, except when one of its ancestors has a transform, perspective, or filter property set to something other than none (see the CSS Transforms Spec), in which case that ancestor behaves as the containing block. (Note that there are browser inconsistencies with perspective and filter contributing to containing block formation.) Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left. \n\nThis value always creates a new stacking context.

Note that a sticky element "sticks" to its nearest ancestor that has a "scrolling mechanism" (created when overflow is hidden, scroll, auto, or overlay), even if that ancestor isn\'t the nearest actually scrolling ancestor.

Luckily, that’s easy!\n\nIf you’re wanting to style occurrences of a certain class inside another class, you can write the following:\n\n.nav .nav-item { ... }\n\nThe above targets any .nav-item inside .nav. If you only want those that are immediately inside the .nav as opposed to any level deep, you can add the > character, like so:\n\n.nav > .nav-item { ... }\n\nWant to target a button only if it’s next to another button? The + character has got you covered:\n\n.button + .button { ... }",

              "Here is a video introduction to hooks:\nhttps://youtu.be/dpw9EHDh2bM\n\n\nHooks let you use state and other React features without writing a class.\n\n\nExample of the useState hook:\n\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Example() {\n  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call \"count\"  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\n        Click me\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nA few snippets from https://softwareontheroad.com/react-hooks/\n\n\n When you work with Reactjs class components you can use state, that’s why these components are also called stateful, also every class component has lifecycle methods like: componentDidMount(), componentDidUpdate(), and so on.\n\nYou can’t use any of this in functional components. Functional components can’t use their own state and don’t have lifecycle methods.\n\nNow with React hooks you can.\n\nReact hooks allows us to take a Reactjs functional component and add state and lifecycle methods to it.\n\nIn simple words, React hooks are special functions to extend the capabilities of functional components and give them the possibility to have lifecycle events and manage state.\n\n\nThe existing React hooks 🍱\n\nThe new API comes with two main pre-existing hooks, and some others for other use cases\nBasics React hooks\n\nThe foundation of all React hooks, every other hook you will see is a variation of these three or are using them as primitives.\n\n    useState is the State hook use it for declaring the state in your components\n    useEffect is the Side effects hook use it for data fetching, manually changing the DOM, and etc.\n    useContext use it in conjunction with Reactjs Context API. When the React Context provider updates, this hook will trigger render with the latest context value.\n\nAdvance React hooks\n\nThese are the most important of the other built-in React hooks that come with the library.\n\n    The useReducer is an alternative to useState, you should use it when you have complex state logic, if you’re familiar with Redux you will like it.\n    The useRef use it for accessing a DOM element with a mutable ref object. Is more useful than the ref attribute\n\n\n\nRules\n\n    Never call Hooks from inside a loop, condition or nested function\n    Never call a Hook from a regular function\n    Only call them inside functions components or custom hooks\n    Hooks should sit at the top level of your component\n    Hooks can call other Hooks\n\n\n\n",

              "Comparing to see if two objects are not really just one referencing the other: Object.is(). This will tell us if one is really just a variable that was passed a reference to the original object, like with: const var1 = obj1; This is only a reference, so Object.is(var1, obj1) will equal true. If so, the values will always be identical.\n\nComparing unique objects can be a little more involved. There is a loose approach and a more strict approach. \n\nWe can test the number of entries in each, as a different number of entries would indicate they are different. We can do this by checking if one has more keys than the other using Object.keys().length or Object.getOwnPropertyNames().length.\nWhen iterating through the objects, we must also account for the possibility of nested arrays and/or objects. These might even go many levels deep.\n\nOne way is to turn both objects into strings using JSON.stringify() and then compare the strings. This will ONLY work if we know the keys will always be IN THE SAME ORDER. When using this method, any variance, like a key being in a different place, will cause the comparison to fail even though the values might be identical.\n\nA more strict approach is to iterate through each object and check the key-value pair against the other. This will work even if the keys are not in the same order. \n\n\nconst user1 = {\n  first: 'Lando',\n  last: 'Calrissian'\n};\nconst user2 = {\n  first: 'Lando',\n  last: 'Calrissian'\n};\n\n\n// Direct comparison\nconsole.log(user1 === user2);  // false\n\n// Stringify process\nconst stringObj1 = JSON.stringify(user1);\nconst stringObj2 = JSON.stringify(user2);\n\nconsole.log(typeof stringObj1);  // string\nconsole.log(stringObj1 === stringObj2);  // true\n\n\n\n// Iterating process possibiltiy\nfunction isSameObject (obj1, obj2) {\n  const props1 = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj1);\n  const props2 = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj2);\n\n  if (props1.length !== props2.length) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < props1.length; i++) {\n    const property = props1[i];\n\n    if (props1[property] !== props2[property]) {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return true;\n}\n\nconsole.log(isSameObject(user1, user2));  // true",

            answer:
              "A pseudo-element in CSS is similar to a pseudo-class in that it uses a keyword added to a selector, but he similarities end there. CSS pseudo-elements let us style a specific part of elements or even add to the beginning or end of the element. In addition, a pseudo-element will use double colons between the keyword and the selector. Technically, because this double-colon convention was not in place early on, the spec still allows this. That said, it is still expected that double colons are used.\n\n\nA few examples:\n\n::after - This creates an inline pseudo-element as the lst child of an element.\n\n::before - Similar to the above, this creates an inline pseudo-element as the first child of an element.\n\n::first-letter - This will apply styles to the first letter of the first line of an element.\n\n::first-line - This works like ::first-letter, but the style will apply to the whole line. What qualifies for the first line will depend on the width of the element, font size and other similar factors.\n\n::selection - When the user highlights a section, usually by clicking and dragging the mouse across text, we can style this highlighted area using the ::selection pseudo-element.\n\n\nDrop this example into an online editor, like https://codepen.io/pen/, to see a few of the pseudo-elements work their magic:\n\nCSS\n\tp::first-letter {\n\t\tfont-size: 50px;\n\t}\n\n\tp::first-line {\n\t\tcolor: orange;\n\t\tletter-spacing: 0.5em;\n\t}\n\n\tp::before {\n\t\tcontent: 'THIS IS BEFORE ---- ';\n\t\tcolor: darkblue;\n\t\tbackground-color: yellowgreen;\n\t}\n\n\tp::after {\n\t\tcontent: '--- THIS IS AFTER';\n\t\tbackground: gray;\n\t\tcolor: aquamarine;\n\t}\n\n\nHTML\n\t<p>The first line will be orange and have letter-spacing applied. The first line changes as the element size changes. The resat of the line will be black, except for the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements. \n\t</p>\n\n",

Promises allow values to be returned much like synchronous methods, just not immediately. In the interim, the Promise, acting as the placeholder, allow the program to move on and will then provide the results of the request whenever they are ready.\n\nA Promise is always either:\n\n    pending: This is the default state. No value is ready nor has anything been rejected.\n    fulfilled: This means the request was completed successfully and the results will be returned.\n    rejected: As it sounds, the operation failed. This will return a reason for the rejection.\n\nA few approaches to handle the results of Promises, we can either chain then() methods with a catch() or use Async/Await. Note: If using Async/Await, it is a good idea to wrap it in a try-catch block to handle a possible rejection.",

              'From Wikipedia:\n\nIn computing, tree shaking is a dead code elimination technique that is applied when optimizing code written in ECMAScript dialects like Dart, JavaScript, or TypeScript into a single bundle that is loaded by a web browser. Rather than eliminating code that can never be executed, tree shaking starts from entry point and includes only the code that is guaranteed to be executed.[1] It is succinctly described as "live code inclusion".\nHistory\n\nDead code elimination in dynamic languages is a much harder problem than in static languages. The idea of a "treeshaker" originated in LISP[2] in the 1990s. The idea is that all possible execution flows of a program can be represented as a tree of function calls, so that functions that are never called can be eliminated.\n\nThe algorithm was applied to JavaScript in Google Closure Tools and then to Dart in the dart2js compiler also written by Google, presented by Bob Nystrom in 2012[3][4] and described by the book "Dart in Action" by author Chris Buckett in 2013:\n\n    When code is converted from Dart to JavaScript the compiler does \'tree shaking\'. In JavaScript you have to add an entire library even if you only need it for one function, but thanks to tree shaking the Dart-derived JavaScript only includes the individual functions that you need from a library\n    — Chris Buckett\n\nThe next wave of popularity of the term is attributed to Rich Harris\'s Rollup project[5] developed in 2015.\nRelation to ECMAScript 6 modules\n\nThe popularity of tree shaking in JavaScript is based on the fact that in distinction from CommonJS modules, ECMAScript 6 module loading is static and thus the whole dependency tree can be deduced by statically parsing the syntax tree. Thus tree shaking becomes an easy problem. However, tree shaking does not only apply at the import/export level: it can also work at the statement level, depending on the implementation.[citation needed] ',

              "A clip from:\nhttps://www.katalon.com/resources-center/blog/ci-cd-introduction/\n\n\nCI/CD is the acronym for the combined practices of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). CI/CD practices are currently the most widely accepted choice to shorten software development and delivery cycle time.\n\n\nWhat is Continuous Integration?\n\nIn a CI practice, developers build, run, and test code on their own workstations before committing code to the version control repository. After changes are made to the repository, a chain of events is put into motion. A typical first step in this chain is to build the latest version of source code. If the build is successful, unit tests are executed. If unit testing succeeds, the build is deployed to test environments where system tests are performed (usually using automated tests). The team is notified about the status of this process, and a report is delivered to provide details, such as build number, defects, and the number of tests.\n\n\nWhat is Continuous Delivery?\n\nCD makes it possible to release builds to the production environment when needed. Allowing the team to deploy at will, CD effectively reduces time to market.\n\nBefore deploying software to production, the CD process includes performing automated system testing, unit testing (including API testing and load testing), and integration testing. The steps from CI to CD are usually completed automatically, including automated testing at the unit, integration, and system levels. As tests can fail at any level and environment, CI/CD must include a feedback channel to quickly report failures to developers.",

If we take pride in what we do, how we do it and how we treat others, we should be proud enough to talk about it.\n\nUltimately, we just need to give a brief bit of detail about why something about us or our work is good. "I am a hard worker" followed up with how teammates always know, perhaps even commented, that we would get the job done and meet deadlines. Perhaps a bit about how some colleagues have become good friends. Maybe a little highlighting of how a boss liked to throw complicated or new things at us because he or she knew how well we can handle ourselves. This will all, of course, be personal and unique, but the general idea is just to showcase the positive affects that our personality, work ethic and passion have had on the people we worked with and the companies we worked for.\n\n\n',

              'This question is sometimes asked because it is more of an intermediate to advanced topic, given that it deals with both how things are layered, how an element\'s parent affects this and how the position property setting can change things.\n\n\tHere are the basics to know:\n\t- z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky).\n\n\t- Elements usually stack with the items that are lower in the DOM appearing on top. z-index can change that for an element using a integer. The higher the number, the higher it goes on the element stack.\n\n\t- Understanding how the parent-child relationship works is very important for understanding how z-index will affect the elements. If element A has children, but element B sits on top of it, then no child element A can ever be higher than element B. No matter how high we make the z-index setting. \n\n\t- You can animate z-index, but it is either behind or in front of an element. It will not transition from one to the other. \n\n\tAn example that can be dropped into an online editor like https://codepen.io/pen/ :\n\n\n\t\tCSS\n\t\t\tdiv {\n\t\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\t\tbackground: black;\n\t\t\tcolor: white;\n\t\t\twidth: 100%;\n\t\t\ttop: 35%;\n\t\t\ttext-align: center;\n\t\t\tpadding: 1em\n\t\t}\n\n\t\timg {\n\t\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\t\tleft: 25%;\n\t\t\ttop: 0;\n\t\t\tz-index: -1;\n\t\t\tmargin: 0 auto;\n\t\t}\n\n\n\t\tHTML\n\t\t    <div><h1>Toggle the image\'s z-index property to watch it go backwards and forwards.</h1>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random" width="50%">\n',

              "Content Security Policy (CSP) is an HTTP header that allows site operators fine-grained control over where resources on their site can be loaded from. The use of this header is the best method to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Due to the difficulty in retrofitting CSP into existing websites, CSP is mandatory for all new websites and is strongly recommended for all existing high-risk sites.\n\nThe primary benefit of CSP comes from disabling the use of unsafe inline JavaScript. Inline JavaScript – either reflected or stored – means that improperly escaped user-inputs can generate code that is interpreted by the web browser as JavaScript. By using CSP to disable inline JavaScript, you can effectively eliminate almost all XSS attacks against your site.",

Some interviewers will press this and, possible, be somewhat abrasive and aggressive here. The idea is that they want to see if we know what makes us special, what makes us valuable and why we are a definite good investment. We need to articulate how strengths and be prepared for a reply that challenges this, perhaps like "Everyone does that...", or similar. This part of the interview is not really about our abilities with specific technologies, but more about how we make people around us better, how we have a strong positive impact on teams and how we will not just write the code that is needed, but use our passion, soft skills, and any other personal and professional traits to move projects and teams forward. This needs to be personal and positive.\n\n\n\tSome thoughts to guide this answer:\n\n\tWe are unique; make it obvious.\n\tWe have experience successfully working with others; make it known.\n\tWe have a desire for growth; show why that matters.\n\tWe have natural & leaned skills; relate them to the job and the team.\n\tWe have tremendous ability; showcase it.\n\tWe have passion; make it felt.\n\tWe make a positive impact.\n\tWe are an solid investment.',

              'From Wikipedia.org:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing\n\nA/B testing (also known as bucket testing or split-run testing) is a user experience research methodology. [1] A/B tests consist of a randomized experiment with two variants, A and B.[2][3] It includes application of statistical hypothesis testing or "two-sample hypothesis testing" as used in the field of statistics. A/B testing is a way to compare two versions of a single variable, typically by testing a subject\'s response to variant A against variant B, and determining which of the two variants is more effective.[4] \n\n\nHere is a nice excerpt from this article:\nhttps://crossbrowsertesting.com/blog/visual-testing/ab-testing-screenshots/\n\n"One of the more common testing practices that marketers experiment with is A/B testing, which lets you test two scenarios at once to determine which your audience responds to better. This is done by having control and variable scenarios, which are randomly displayed to users when they visit your site.\n\nThese changes can be as small as testing the color of a CTA button to seeing whether adding a video on a landing page will increase registrations. For example, one user may see a green “Sign Up Now” button, while the other sees a red one. During an A/B test, you may look to see which one gets more clicks in order to inform which color you want to set the button to."\n\nA/B testing tools from a list complied in:\nhttps://www.ventureharbour.com/best-a-b-testing-tools/\n\nGoogle Analytics & Google Optimize - Free\nOptimizely\nVWO\nZoho PageSense\nHubSpot\nLeadformly\nUnbounce\nConvertize\nKameleoon\nConvert\n',

            question: "",
            answer:
              'A very complete answer from:\nhttps://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-create-a-multicolor-text-in-html-and-css.html\n\nYou can create a multicolor text with the help of image editors such as Pixelmator, Photoshop and so on. So, you can create a multicolor image and embed it into your website.\nThe multicolor text will not be searchable with this method.\n\nAs a result, your code will look like the following:\n\n<img src="multicolortext.png"/>\n\nMake separate elements¶\n\nAnother way is creating a text with separate elements by using the HTML <span> tag, which is an empty container. This means that you create a multicolor text by putting each letter in a separate element to define a different color for each letter of your text.\nExample of creating a multicolor text with separate elements in HTML:¶\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Title of the document</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <span style="color:#FF0000">H</span>\n    <span style="color:#66CC66">e</span>\n    <span style="color:#FF9966">l</span>\n    <span style="color:#FFCCCC">l</span>\n    <span style="color:#FF0066">o</span>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\nTry it Yourself »\nResult¶\nUse CSS¶\n\nAnd finally, you can use CSS. This is the easiest way of creating such kind of text.\n\nPut your text in a <span> tag and give it a class name "multicolortext". Then, you need the CSS background-image property to add a gradient background to your text with its "linear-gradient" value, where you put the names of your preferred colors.\n\nTo get multicolor text instead of the multicolor background, you need to use the background-clip property, which lets you control how far a background image or color extends beyond the element\'s padding or content. This step gives some colors to your text, but not exactly what you want.\n\nYou can get the final result by making your text color transparent with the color property so that the background color will be reflected in the text.\nExample of creating a multicolor text with HTML and CSS:¶\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>The title of the document</title>\n    <style>\n      .multicolortext {\n        background-image: linear-gradient(to left, violet, indigo, green, blue, yellow, orange, red);\n        -webkit-background-clip: text;\n        -moz-background-clip: text;\n        background-clip: text;\n        color: transparent;\n      }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>\n      <span class="multicolortext">Let’s be creative!</span>\n    </h1>\n  </body>\n</html>',

This is an opportunity to drive home areas where the companies and our interests mesh nicely. In addition, knowing how we want to be better just one year from now can show a commitment to constant growth.\n- Give a brief outline of what your ideal professional self would be five years from now. Make it real and doable, but still a bit of a long reach. Unrealistic goals or extremely small goals are not going to help us look any better. High, but achievable, goals can be inspiring.\n- The five-year goals can include:\n\t\t- A higher understanding of certain principles.\n\t\t- More experience and deeper knowledge in one or two technologies (ideally ones that are associated with the job being considered).\n\t\t- A general increased role and professional status, like becoming a senior dev, leading a team or even entering into management.\n\t\t- One or two new languages, tools or processes that would build on the current ones (ideally meshing with what the company offers, if possible).\n\t\t- Certain experience within a team or some similar goal that relates to being even better working with others.\n\t\t- Conferences, talks, meetups, projects related to career path, etc.\n- Give a brief outline of what your ideal personal self would be five years from now. This can be anything at all and should definitely be genuine. Family life, personal project (writing a book, starting a group, etc), growing hobbies or adding new ones, physical fitness, etc.",

There are a number of methods including play() and pause() as well as load().\n\n- Text Track API: Picking up where the Media API leaves off, the Text Track API allows us to interact with text tracks (subtitles or captions) for the audio and videos.\n\n- Drag and Drop: There are a number of possibilities with this API. Among these, you can add  'draggable' attribute to allow a user to move an element then have event handlers in place on a drop zone so the browser knows where the element can be dropped.\n\n- History API: This spec gives developers more control of the user's browser session. Along with moving the the user forward or backward, we can check the length of the history and even add or remove entries. We can hold data enabling us to restore a page or just update the URL without refreshing the page.\n",

              'Accessibility has become a very big focus for many companies. Knowing they are hiring people that can support this effort is important. The goal for an answer to any question about accessibility is to show that we have a basic understanding combined with being able to about real-world use.\n\nAccessibility is no longer just something nice to incorporate, it is essential for making sure people, best practices and, in some cases, laws are being respected. \n\nA few accessibility features we can incorporate:\n\nThoughtful contrasting colors for people who have trouble seeing color. This allows them to see a difference between two colored areas.\n\nAria labels are important for signalling correct detail to screen readers.\n\nUsing tags instead of CSS properties, like <em> instead of font-weight, will signal to screen-readers the intent to emphasis. This can then be past along to the user.\nThere are tools available, like Lighthouse now included in Chrome Dev Tools, that can run scans and alert us to accessibility concerns.\n\n\nHere is an example of the <em> and an aria label:\n\n\n    <p>Hi my name is Sheev Palpatine, but you can call me <em>EMPORER DARTH SIDIOUS</em></p>\n\n    <button aria-label="Close Modal">Close</button>',

HTTP2 adds a number of features to manage the streams, but leaves old semantics untouched.\n\n\nHTTP/2 supports queries multiplexing, headers compression, priority and more intelligent packet streaming management. This results in reduced latency and accelerates content download on modern web pages.",

This is usually not a good idea as it creates difficult to edit document with potentially inconsistent styling. It is important to separate concerns for multi-faceted projects like web pages.\n\n\t<h1 style="color: blue;">Example</h1>\n\n- <style> tags in the documents <head> can be used to assign selectors to declarations. The browser will then link classes used on the elements in the <body> to the selectors in the <style> tag. This will apply CSS to the page.\n\n\tThis is better than inline styles, but still not ideal as we are not separating the styling from the structure.\n\n\t<style>\n        .selector-name {\n            color: red;\n        }\n    </style>\n\n- The most versatile, clear and maintainable method is using external style sheets. We can bring these in using a <link> tag in the document\'s <head>. The browser will then using the selctors in the external style sheet to link to classes on the page elements and apply the associated declarations.\n\n\tThe most versatile, clear and maintainable because it enables a sheet, or sheets, with only CSS-related material. We can group selectors as we see fit and even separate them into separate sheets when the need arises. If anyone ever needs to jump in, they will have a much easier time finding what they need and making changes over the inline or <style> tag methods.\n\n\t<link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css">\n',

This can sometimes be concerning for a company as they might think that makes us a short-term investment or, much worse, a bad investment due to some inability to get along with people or perform.\nThis question is our opportunity to remove these doubts. A simple explanation can go a long way, even if there was a bad situation and we can speak to how we learned from it.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with wanting to make more money or move up in role or even just find a culture that meshes better with our values, work ethic and/or future goals. We just need to give a brief reasoning that includes our thoughts surrounding big moves, our steps to work with our current employer before making th e moves and how those decisions ended up being good or, perhaps, lessons that we learned from those that did not.\n\nUltimately, we don't want to lie or give the impression we are trying to cover anything up. There are always reasons and many of them are good reasons. Taking advantage of opportunities for personal or professional advancement are definitely good reasons.

            answer:
              "This question is designed to see our thought process on this issue.\n\nHere are some basic steps for approaching a slow app:\n\n\t1. Define the specific problem. What, specifically is slow? Is the initial load slow? Are page transitions slow? Do the interactions, like menu animations, seem slow or choppy? Does this occur on only some browsers or devices? \n\n\t\tUltimately, the goal here is to get as clear a picture as possible as of each part that is slow. This enables us to find the best spots to begin drilling down.\n\n\t2. Narrow the scope: Next we want to take our drill-down points and begin to narrow each of those to as small a piece of code as we can. \n\n\t\tFor instance, if the issue is slow loading, a good place to start is either Chrome Dev Tools' Lighthouse tool or a page speed analyzer. One popular one is: \n\n\t\thttps://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/\n\n\t\tThese tools can help see where it is slow, like the first paint or how long until a user can actually interact with the page. From there it can help us pinpoint potential problem areas, like large images or slow server response.\n\n\t\tin a browser's dev tools we can use other tools, like the Network section to see detail on specific items like when they loaded, how long they took and if they were blocking progress. \n\n\t\tIf the issue is something not related to resources loading, dev tools can help narrow down the search using the Debugger, Performance, Inspector, Console and others. \n\n\t3. Isolate: Once we gained an understanding of the specific symptoms and then narrowed the scope of our attention, we can now address these specific areas of code. Dev tools Debugger can be great for stepping through JavaScript. The Performance tool can help see how an animation affects the page processing. \n\n\t\tIf need be, it can help to isolate specific blocks of code in a separate editor, perhaps even an online editor like repl.it, codepen.io or jsbin.com. This can help zero-in on specific problems in the code.\n\t\tAlong the same line of thinking, commenting out blocks of code and/or temporarily inserting new simplified code can help ensure we have properly identified the problem area.\n\n\t4. Fix: By this point, we have arrived at the problem pieces of code. Now, we just need to correct the issue.\n\n\t5. Test...a lot: We have not fixed the problem at this point. We have only written the code that we think will correct the issue. Test. Test. Test then take a break...test again. At that point, we have fixed teh issue.",

              'There are a wide array of strategies for this answer. Below are a few basic approaches, though a web search (click the "More About this Question" button for that) will yield a wealth of detail and other options.\n\n- We can just give an amount we would like to make and we think we are worth. it is simple and direct, though it might be a factor in eliminating us from the candidate list if the number far exceeds what the company wants to spend on the position or thinks we are worth. This approach is not concerned with staying in market value. It is more about weeding out companies that can not or do not wish to pay what we value our services at. \n\n- We can take our current salary and just raise that a little. Assuming we are applying for a similar position, or even slightly elevated, this keeps us around market range. \n\n- If the job is meant to be an entry into a new career, pushing for more money might hurt the greater purpose. We might want to consider looking for the salary range listed in the job post and speaking to an amount towards the middle, with a minimum around the listed minimum. Or, perhaps, if our situation is one where little more or less would not matter and getting in the door is the focus, being honest about this can be OK. It would be best to also ask how soon someone is eligible for a raise and to make sure they do not offer below their posted minimum. There are some who would say never ask for or imply the offered minimum, but getting the first foot in can make a tremendous difference and then enable us to make the next interview about what we are really worth.\n\n- Use online tools to find a market salary range and then ask for a salary somewhere between the average and the top salary depending on where our skills and experience put us.\n\n\n\tA few tools for finding market value:\n\n\t\tGlassDoor: https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/index.htm\n\t\tPayScale: https://www.payscale.com/my/survey/choose\n\t\tLinkedin Salary Tool: https://www.linkedin.com/salary/',

            answer:
              'This answer comes from:\nhttps://resource-centre.net/html5-tutorials/bullet-point-lists/\n\nBullet Point Lists (or Unordered Lists)\n\nThe first kind of list we will look at is using bullets.\nUnordered List – the <ul> Tag\n\nBullet point lists are also known as unordered lists (UL) because there is no numbering involved. That is why a bulleted list uses the <ul> </ul> tag pair. Here is a basic example:\n\nThe whole list is surrounded by <ul> </ul> for a start. When you open your list tag, make sure you automatically type your closing tag and then proceed to fill your items between them.\nThe type Attribute\n\nThe type attribute determines what kind of bullet you are seeing on the page. Although through CSS you can specify a wide-range of bullet styles, and even use your own image, in raw HTML it is best to stick with the common types which are\n\n    type="circle" – an unfilled circle\n\n    type="disc" – a filled circle\n\n    type="square" – a filled square\n\nList Items – the <li> Tag\n\nEach individual item in your list is wrapped in its own <li> </li> tag pair. You can often get away without the </li> but I would recommend keeping it in, just so you maintain healthy coding habit.\n\nThe list above I placed in individual <ul> but each <li> also supports the type attribute, such that I could create\n\n    Square\n    Disc\n    Circle\n\nNot sure why you would want to do that, but you can if you want to!\n\nBullet List Indentation\n\nBefore you apply any CSS to your list, HTML (or more accurately, your browser) will apply indentation to your list, so it stands out from your normal paragraph <p> tags.\nOrdered / Numbered Lists – the <ol> Tag\n\nIf you want to present your list in an ordered fashion, then the <ol> tag is your friend. By default this will give you a numbered list, but the type attribute gives you flexibility, in the same way as bullet point lists do.\n\nwhich outputs\n\n    Item 1\n    Item 2\n    Item 3\n\nThe type attribute offers a few more options in ordered lists compared to bulleted ones. A bit more guidance on this can be obtained at W3Schools.\nStarting an Ordered List On A Different Number\n\nSay you were putting together some instructions to build a table. You may want to use a numbered list to achieve this. However, if you wanted to put images and extra text between each stage, you would probably need multiple lists. The problem is that each list starts at number 1 (or letter A) by default. That would screw up your instructions!\n\nThankfully HTML has the start property to allow you to start on a subsequent number:\n\nThis outputs:\n\n    Step Four\n    Step Five\n    Step Six\n\nReversing The Order\n\nIf you want to show your numbers (or letters) in reverse order, then this is really easy too. You might want to do a ‘Top 10’ with your best item announced last, for example. This can be done by adding the word reversed into your Ordered List opening tag:\n\nAnd this would make your list look like this:\n\n    First LI\n    Second LI\n    Third LI\n    Fourth LI\n    Fifth LI\n\nMulti-Level Bullet List in HTML\n\nWith patchy browser support (and sometimes undone by CSS in some sites) you can create a multilevel list. This is achieved by embedding one list inside another:\n\nWhich creates:\n\n    Top Level Item\n        Sub-Item 1\n        Sub-Item 2\n    Top Level Item\n\nYou can use a combination of <ul> and <ol>. That may be useful if you want bullet points under a numbered list.\n\n    Top Level Item\n        Sub-Item 1\n        Sub-Item 2\n    Top Level Item\n',

In either case, we need to work into the interview an example or two that showcases our ability to work with others. Overall, we want to exhibit good communication skills, and a brief bit about how important we think communication skills are when working with teams, or our superiors, the client, etc can help. Perhaps even a story about a time when kept our calm when others did not, or an example of how we set aside things that bothered us, and were able to generate harmony that helped move a project forward. All of this needs to be delivered, like all of our answers, with good eye contact without staring, enthusiasm married with a calm and thoughtful approach and general good will and respectful manner. These qualities can mean a lot to a company and can raise our profile above others in the eyes of the interviewer.\n",

              'The following excerpt come from bitofco.de:\nhttps://bitsofco.de/understanding-the-virtual-dom/\n\nWhy do we need a virtual DOM?\n\nTo understand why the concept of the virtual DOM arose, let’s revisit the original DOM. As I mentioned, there are two parts to the DOM - the object-based representation of the HTML document and the API to manipulating that object.\n\nFor example, let’s take this simple HTML document with an unordered list and one list item.\n\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang="en">\n <head></head>\n <body>\n    <ul class="list">\n        <li class="list__item">List item</li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\n\nThis document can be represented as the following DOM tree:\n\nhtml\nhead lang="en"\nbody\nul class="list"\nli class="list__item"\n"List item"\n\nLet’s say we want to modify the content of the first list item to \n"List item one"\n and also add a second list item. To do this, we will need use the DOM APIs to find the elements we want to update, create the new elements, add attributes and content, then finally update the DOM elements themselves.\n\nconst listItemOne = document.getElementsByClassName("list__item")[0];\nlistItemOne.textContent = "List item one";\n\nconst list = document.getElementsByClassName("list")[0];\nconst listItemTwo = document.createElement("li");\nlistItemTwo.classList.add("list__item");\nlistItemTwo.textContent = "List item two";\nlist.appendChild(listItemTwo);\n\nThe DOM wasn’t made for this…\n\nWhen the first specification for the DOM was released in 1998, we built and managed web pages in very differently. There was far less reliance on the DOM APIs to create and update the page content as frequently as we do today.\n\nSimple methods such as \ndocument.getElementsByClassName()\n are fine to use on a small scale, but if we are updating multiple elements on a page every few seconds, it can start to become really expensive to constantly query and update the DOM.\n\nEven further, because of the way the APIs are setup, it is usually simpler to perform more expensive operations where we update larger parts of the document than to find and update the specific elements. Going back to our list example, it is in some ways easier to replace the entire unordered list with a new one than to modify the specific elements.\n\nconst list = document.getElementsByClassName("list")[0];\nlist.innerHTML = `\n<li class="list__item">List item one</li>\n<li class="list__item">List item two</li>\n`;\n\n\nIn this particular example, the performance difference between the methods is probably insignificant. However, as the size of the web page grows, it becomes more important to only select and update what is needed.\n\n… but the virtual DOM was!\n\nThe virtual DOM was created to solve these problems of needing to frequently update the DOM in a more performant way. Unlike the DOM or the shadow DOM, the virtual DOM isn\'t an official specification, but rather a new method of interfacing with the DOM.\n\nA virtual DOM can be thought of as a copy of the original DOM. This copy can be frequently manipulated and updated, without using the DOM APIs. Once all the updates have been made to the virtual DOM, we can look at what specific changes need to be made to the original DOM and make them in a targetted and optimised way.',

In the common case of HTML, the rendering engine parses HTML and CSS, and displays the parsed content on the screen.\n\n    Networking: network calls such as HTTP requests, using different implementations for different platform behind a platform-independent interface.\n\n    UI backend: This exposes a generic interface that is not platform specific. Underneath it uses operating system user interface methods all for drawing basic items like combo boxes and windows. \n\n    JavaScript interpreter: Used to parse and execute JavaScript code.\n\n    Data storage: The browser may need to save all sorts of data locally, such as cookies. Browsers also support storage mechanisms such as localStorage, IndexedDB, WebSQL and FileSystem.\n\nThe flow:\n\n           | <--------  USER INTERFACE\t\t\t\t________\nUI BACKEND |\t                 V\t\t\t\t\t     DATA\n           |            BROWSER ENGINE --------->  STORAGE\n           |                  V\t\t\t\t       ---------\n           | <------   RENDERING ENGINE\n                         V\t        V\t        \t\n                  NETWORKING   JAVASCRIPT INTERPRETER    \n",

We just need to show we understand the general process.\n\n- We initiate a request using the domain name system with the URL as an address. \n- The server that houses the address will be located via the internet and the request is made.\n- The server then serves up the requested data.\n- The data is transferred via the web back to the browser.\n- \t\n\n\n- The web browser that you are using will contact a DNS (Domain Name System) server.\n- The DNS will translate the website name into a numeric IP address (every website domain name is basically an alias for an IP address). \n- The IP address is sent to the browser.\n- The browser uses this IP address to locate the server hosting the web page and, using the TCP protocol, opens a connection via port 80 on the server. In some cases, authentication can be part of this connection. This might be a JSON web token, or some other data, included in the request.\n- The server will then send the requested data to the browser.\n- The browser will then render the page to the screen. \n\n- The new web page might include dependencies, like CSS ot JavaScript sheets, or images, etc. The browser will then either request these via the same connection, or, if the begin the process for a new connection to retrieve each item.\n\n- Once the browser page (tab or window) is closed, the connection to the server ends.\n\n",

            answer:
              "instanceof is used to determine the prototype origin of an object; basically the class that created it.\n\nPopper use would be:\nclass Circle {}\nconst circle = new Circle();\n\nconsole.log(circle instanceof Circle);  //true\nconsole.log(circle instanceof Object);  //true\n\n\nHere is how it can be misused: Some will try to use it instead of typeof. It will not always give the expected results when used for that and should never be attempted.\nIn the example below, we see how it can work like typeof and then how it will not work in two scenarios that appear almost the same.\n\t\nconsole.log(new String('Hello World')  instanceof String);  // true\n\nconsole.log('hello world' instanceof String);  // false",

              'Excerpts from w3.org:\n\nThe World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community where Member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop Web standards. Led by Web inventor and Director Tim Berners-Lee and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe, W3C\'s mission is to lead the Web to its full potential.\n\n\nWhat does W3C do?\n\nW3C\'s primary activity is to develop protocols and guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the Web. W3C\'s standards define key parts of what makes the World Wide Web work. Learn more about W3C\'s mission.\nWhere is W3C located?\n\nW3C does not have a single physical headquarters. There are four institutions, however, that "host" W3C: MIT (in Cambridge, MA, USA), ERCIM (in Sophia-Antipolis, France), Keio University (near Tokyo, Japan), and Beihang University (in Beijing, China).\n\nThe W3C staff is distributed around the world, but there are concentrations of people in Cambridge, Massachusetts (USA), Sophia-Antipolis (France), and Tokyo (Japan). In addition, W3C is represented in 17 other regions of the world via representatives based at organizations. W3C calls these regional points of contact "W3C Offices."\nHow is W3C funded?\n\nW3C receives funds from:\n\n    W3C Member dues\n    Research grants and other sources of private and public funding\n    Individual donations of money and equipment \n\nWhat is the difference between the Web and the Internet?\n\nFrom the definition in the Wikipedia: "The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that interchange data by packet switching using the standardized Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)."\n\nThus, the Internet is a network of networks, defined by the TPC/IP standards.\n\nThe Web, on the other hand, is defined in W3C\'s Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume I as follows: "The World Wide Web (WWW, or simply Web) is an information space in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI)."\n\nThus, the Web is an information space. The first three specifications for Web technologies defined URLs, HTTP, and HTML.\n',

            answer:
              'All of this addresses the loading of documents and how they affect the main document.\n\nFrom:https://javascript.info/script-async-defer\n\n\nDEFER:\n\nThe defer attribute tells the browser not to wait for \nthe script. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, \nbuild DOM. The script loads “in the background”, and then runs when the \nDOM is fully built.\n\nHere’s the same example with defer:\n<p>...content before script...</p>\n\n<scrip/t defer src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js?speed=1"></scrip/t>\n\n<!-- visible immediately -->\n<p>...content after script...</p>\n\n\nIn other words:\n\n    - Scripts with defer never block the page.\n    - Scripts with defer always execute when the DOM is ready (but before DOMContentLoaded event).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASYNC\n\nThe async attribute is somewhat like \ndefer. It also makes the script non-blocking. But it has important differences in the behavior.\n\nThe async attribute means that a script is completely independent:\n\n    - The browser doesn’t block on async scripts (like defer).\n    - Other scripts don’t wait for async scripts, and async scripts don’t wait for them.\n    - DOMContentLoaded and async scripts don’t wait for each other:\n        | DOMContentLoaded may happen both before an async script (if an async script finishes loading after the page is complete)\n        | …or after an async script (if an async script is short or was in HTTP-cache)\n\n    <p>...content before scripts...</p>\n\n    <scrip/t>\n      document.addEventListener(\'DOMContentLoaded\', () => alert("DOM ready!"));\n    </scrip/t>\n\n    <scrip/t async src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js"></scrip/t>\n    <scrip/t async src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/small.js"></scrip/t>\n\n    <p>...content after scripts...</p>\n\n\n\nThe following examples come from: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/html-preload-prefetch\n\n\n    \nPRELOAD\n\nPreloading JavaScript resources is done differently. This example, taken from this Google Developers article on preloading, shows this:\nindex.html\n\n<link rel="preload" href="used-later.js" as="scrip/t">\n<!-- ... -->\n<scrip/t>\n  var usedLaterScript = document.createElement(\'script\');\n  usedLaterScript.src = \'used-later.js\';\n  document.body.appendChild(usedLaterScript);\n</scrip/t>\n\n\n\nPREFETCH\n\nPrefetching works similarly to preloading. The difference is that, \nwhen prefetching a resource, the browser considers the resource to be \nlow priority. This means that the resource or asset will load a bit \nlater. Because of this, prefetching is usually implemented with \nresources that are not required initially, but are used at a later \npoint.\n\nTo implement prefectching in your HTML page, change the value of \nrel to "prefetching.\n\nindex.html\n<link\n  rel="prefetch"\n  as="style"\n  onload="this.rel = \'stylesheet\'"\n  href=\'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:100,900|Material+Icons\'>\n',

              'This is generally asked to get an idea of how much someone pays attention to good practices and, ultimately, will write easier to understand code and have an easier time jumping into someone else\'s code.\n\nGeneral naming conventions:\n-\tNames should be brief, but descriptive enough that the average non-developer could understand. For example, using "d = new Date()" might serve brevity, but can make no sense later in the program and require extra effort to understand. Conversely, "theDateForTheDayTheAppIsRun = new Date()" is clear, but unnecessarily long. Simply "todaysDate = new Date()" is brief and easily understood.\n\nA few JavaScript examples can be:\n- Camel case for variables: const lastName = \'Kenobi\'\n- Pascal case for classes: class MainCharacter { }\n- "is" or "has" prefix for booleans.\n- Function calls that will be returning something can start with have a descriptive verb ("update", "get", etc).\n- As few variables as possible. This is not really a naming convention, but it greatly affects the abilty for the names of the variables that do get used to be easier to follow and keep track of.\n- Do not re-use variable names.\n- In many cases it is better not to make a variable equal itself with modification. This can be difficult to follow through and can often be better served with a new, variable descriptively named to match the newly formed data.\n- When reasonable, if a specific item in an array is being used, assign a more descriptive variable: const updatedFileId = changes[0]\n- Property names that do not need to be prefixed with the class name. \n\tWe do not need: class Car {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructor(brand, purchaseDate) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.carName = brand;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.carYear = purchaseDate;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n} \n\tInstead, we can use: class Car {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructor(brand) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.name = brand;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.year = purchaseDate;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t} \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t// in use it will still be descriptive\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconst myCar = new Car();\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmyCar,name = \'Jeep\';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmyCar.year = \'2017\';\n- Avoid "magic" numbers, or numbers without a name, when possible. \n\tWe want to avoid: const forwardMovement = duration * 3;\n\tWe can use: const rate = 3;\n\t\t\t\t  forwardMovement = duration * rate;\n\t\t\t\t \n\nCSS & HTML examples:\n- Use nicely cascading rules to make for as few selectors as possible.\n- Kabab case for selectors: .inner-wrap\n- Descriptive selector names. This can be the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) method or similar.\n- Try to avoid using the same name for an ID and a class. These are technically independent from each other, but this can cause confusion for a developer.\n',

In an object literal, the spread syntax enumerates the properties of an object and adds the key-value pairs to the object being created.\n\nSpread syntax looks exactly like rest syntax. In a way, spread syntax is the opposite of rest syntax. Spread syntax "expands" an array into its elements, while rest syntax collects multiple elements and "condenses" them into a single element.

              'This might sound like a silly question, but questions like this sometimes are used to get us to show our understanding of basic, but often needed, aspects of CSS. This will usually be a screening question, so a descriptive verbal outline will needed, not actual code.\n\nTo begin, we need to target our element via ID, or by class for multiple elements. We then want to set an equal width and height, perhaps 100px each. From there, we can either set the border for a few pixels or a background color or even both. This way we can see it. At that point, we have a square.\n\nMaking that square a circle simply requires a border-radius of 50% all of the way around. \n\nNow, that is a fixed width square or circle. We could make it responsive by using a percentage as the width and an equal percentage as padding-bottom. If there is content in the square or circle, one way to keep the sides equal would be to absolutely position the content. Ultimately, this is just an option. There are many ways to approach graphics in CSS, and purpose and the rest of the document will play into a plan for making the graphics responsive.\n\n\nPaste this example into an online editor, like https://codepen.io/pen/, to see the square and circle:\n\n\tCSS\n\t\t.square {\n\t\t\tbackground: lightgreen;\n\t\t\twidth: 50%;\n\t\t\tpadding-bottom: 50%;\n\t\t\tmargin: 0 auto;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t.square.circle {\n\t\t\tborder-radius: 50%;\n\t\t\tbackground: salmon;\n\t\t}\n\n\tHTML\n\t\t<div class="square"></div>\n\n\t\t<div class="square circle"></div>',

            answer:
              "The days of great consideration being paid to Internet Explorer's many differences will, or possibly have, come to an end. This does not mean browser compatibility is no longer a concern. \nModern browsers are much more consistent with including features, but it is still good to check with a tool like https://caniuse.com/ or MDN to make sure new features are well covered.\n\nFor most browsers, we can easily download them and test our app. But what about older versions of each browser? What about these browsers on different devices. What if we need to test on Safari, but do not have access to a Mac? There are tools like https://www.browserstack.com/ to test web apps in many different ways. Some will even monitor real users on different browsers and devices. We can even have automated routines to test these scenarios.  \n\nBeyond testing, it is important that we know well what our target audience is going to be. If it is truly a global reach we are seeking, we need to consider things like Opera Mini (popular in parts of the world with slow internet), Baidu (a popular China-based browser), KaiOS' browser (mobile OS and browser used all over and especially in India) and any others that are used.\n\nAll of this does not mean that wide-reach intentions mean we need to remove most of our JavaScript just to make the app work right on Opera Mini. It just means just that we need to consider what happens to our product for the those users and work towards good solutions. \n\nWhithin any app, we should pay attention to current browser compatibility and utilize thinking along these lines:\n\n\t- We might just need to ensure there are fullbacks in place.\n\n\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\tposition: sticky; // Not fully supported by some browsers\n\n\t- We can plan our interactions and layouts so that nothing critical relies on technology not fully supported.\t\n\n\t- We can check for specific feature support in a browser and have separate functionality ready. This is not ideal as it requires extra consideration when maintaining the web app, but it is a workable solution.\n\n\t- We and the customer can consider the costs vs the gains related to supporting certain browsers. The benefits might not offset the costs of supporting a specific browser's use and/or the areas of the world it is popular.",

              'Some browsers accept additional proprietary non-standard non-css syntax on top of the usual css. Less is build on top of standard css and therefore may not recognize it. You may also need to put an otherwise non-parseable value inside a variable and use it to dynamically build selector or other css part during compilation time.\n\nEscaping allows you to use any arbitrary string as property or variable value. It can be used also to dynamically build selectors, but that feature is deprecated and replaced by different more powerful option.\n\nSyntax\n\nUse either ~"whatever" or ~\'whatever\' syntax to escape property values. Anything between quotes is used as is with almost no changes. The "as is" rule has one exception: string interpolation works with the usual @{variableName} syntax.\n\nUsed as Property Value\n\nSample input:\n\n@variable: "dynamic";\nh1 {\n  margin: 1 ~"2 2" 3;\n  padding: ~\'ms:special.syntax()\';\n  text: ~\'@{variable}\'; //interpolation works\n}\n\ncompiles into:\n\nh1 {\n  margin: 1 2 2 3;\n  padding: ms:special.syntax();\n  text: dynamic;\n}\n\n',

              "Excerpts from hacker.io:\n\nCSS was originally released in 1996 and consists of properties for adding font properties such as typeface and emphasis color of text, backgrounds, and other elements. CSS2 was released in 1998 with added styles for other media types so that it can be used for page layout designing. CSS3 was released in 1999 and presentation-style properties were added in it that allows you to build a presentation from documents.\n\nUnlike CSS2, which was comprised of a single document, CSS3 has its specifications divided into many individual modules, which makes CSS3 a whole lot easier to handle.\n\nWith CSS3, the designers can now use special fonts, like those available in Google Fonts and Typecast. Earlier, with CSS and CSS2, designers could only use “web-safe fonts” for being 100% sure to use fonts that would always display the same on every machine.\n\nWhile CSS and CSS2 had ‘simple selectors’, CSS3 calls the components as ‘a sequence of simple selectors’.\n\nCSS3 came up with some key web design considerations like rounded borders that help in rounding up the borders without any hassle. This turned out to be a huge plus point for developers who were struggling with initial versions of CSS borders.\n\nCSS3 has the capability to split text sections into multiple columns so that it can be read like a newspaper. In CSS2, the developers had difficulty because the standard was not equipped with automatically breaking the text so that it fits within a box.\n\n",

              'Synchronous code runs from top to bottom in order. One line, command, function, etc is processed and resolved before moving to the next. This can be problematic if you encounter "blocking" code, which is code that causes processing one item for a longer amount of time. This means the rest of the program (and end user) wait until the program can mover on to the next line. This is where asynchronous code can be helpful.\n\nAsynchronous code runs separately from other code. This means it can take longer to process without "blocking" the rest of the program from running. In JavaScript, the Call Stack processes code synchronously. If a piece of asynchronous code is encountered, it is moved out of the Call Stack. If it is part of a Web API, like setTimeOut(), then the browser handles the resolving the code. Otherwise, it is moved to the Callback Que. In either case, the Event Loop will take the next item that has resolved, and place it on the Call Stack. This time, when the code can be dealt with in order because it is ready and will not block the processing the rest of the program.',

              "A few basic elements of design are:    \n\n\nLINE – The linear marks made with a pen or brush or the edge created when two shapes meet.    \n\n\nSHAPE – A shape is a self contained defined area of geometric (squares and circles), or organic (free formed shapes or natural shapes). A positive shape automatically creates a negative shape.    \n\n\nDIRECTION – All lines have direction – Horizontal, Vertical or Oblique. Horizontal suggests calmness, stability and tranquility. Vertical gives a feeling of balance, formality and alertness. Oblique suggests movement and action    \n\n\nSIZE – Size is simply the relationship of the area occupied by one shape to that of another.    \n\n\nTEXTURE – Texture is the surface quality of a shape – rough, smooth, soft hard glossy etc.    \n\n\nCOLOR – Color is light reflected off objects. Color has three main characteristics: hue or its name (red, green, blue, etc.), value (how light or dark it is), and intensity (how bright or dull it is).",

            answer:
              "Closure is an inner function, that is accessible outside of its parent function's scope while maintaining its connection to the parent's variables and other data. This can be don to keep some data private and purposely expose other data.\nTo accomplish this, an anonymous function can be immediately invoked. In this function, data we wish to keep  private can be processed. Usually this data would be removed from memory via JavaScript's \"garbage collection\" memory clearing process. If this function returns a function, let's call it a child function, that accesses data from the parent function, the parent's data will remain in memory. In this situation, the only access to the parent function's data will be via whatever had been set up in the child function. In addition, every time the child function is invoked, a new function scope is created for the child function. The parent function scope is only created once. This means that we can invoke the child function to change a variable in the parent and the next time we invoke the child function the variable in the parent will still reflect the change. \n\nThis can be considered state management and might not be as useful today given other options to manage state. Still, this process can be used to protect sensitive data or even just a to keep a counter variable from being accidentally increased.\n\nSome examples\n// For comparison, this is a counter without closure\nlet counter = 0;\n\nfunction add1 () {\n\tcounter++;\n\treturn counter;\n}\n\nconsole.log(add1());  // 1\nconsole.log(add1());  // 2\n// The counter becomes unpredictable when it can be altered elswhere\ncounter++;\nconsole.log(add1());  // 4\n\n\n// This is a counter with closure\nconst add1 = (function () {\n  let counter = 0;\n\n  return function () {\n\tcounter++;\n\treturn counter;\n  };\n})();\nconsole.log(add1());  // 1\nconsole.log(add1());  // 2\nconsole.log(add1());  // 3\ncounter++;// error: counter is not defined\nconsole.log(add1());\n\n// Another, more complex example\n// In this travelAgent() in the child function made available, while \n// the \"trip\" variable and agent() function are accessible through \n// travelAgent(). The book() function, is only accessible through agent().\nfunction vacation() {\n\tvar trip;\n\n\tfunction travelAgent(itinerary) {\n\t\tagent(itinerary);\n\t\treturn trip;\n\t}\n\n\tfunction agent(itinerary) {\n\t\tif (itinerary === 'Orlando') {\n\t\t\ttrip = ['Orlando', 'Disney', 'Universal'];\n\t\t\tbook();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tfunction book() {\n\t\ttrip.push('booked');\n\t}\n\treturn travelAgent;\n}\n\nvar myVacation = vacation();\n\nconsole.log(myVacation('Orlando'));\n\n// Array [ \"Orlando\", \"Disney\", \"Universal\", \"booked\" ]\n",

              "S.O.L.I.D is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin.\n\nS - Single-responsiblity principle. A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.\n\nO - Open-closed principle. Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.\n\nL - Liskov substitution principle. Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.\n\nI - Interface segregation principle. A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.\n\nD - Dependency Inversion Principle. Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.\n\nHere is a good article on the subject: https://dev.to/francescoxx/solid-principles-in-javascript-3pek\n",

              'The best way to answer this question is with a bit of detail about each part of the process, though fine detail is not needed.\n- There are fonts available on the web, with Google Fonts being a common example. There are many other free and paid font sources. \n- We need to download the font documents or get a CDN URL.\n- These can be loaded ito our app via a <link> tag in our <head> section of our HTML sheet:\n\n\t<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Mulish:wght@200&display=swap" rel="stylesheet"> \n\n\tOr, using @import in our style sheet:\n\n\t@import url(\'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Mulish:wght@200&display=swap\');\n\n\n\tOr, if we wish to define a custom font typeface, we can do so using @font-face. This can be very useful, especially if the font is not a web font. For more info on @font-face and when to use it, check this out: \n\n\t\t\thttps://designmodo.com/font-face/\n\n\t\tFor detail on the difference between a typefacr and a font, read this:\n\n\t\t\thttps://www.howtogeek.com/325644/whats-the-difference-between-a-font-a-typeface-and-a-font-family/\n\n\t\tHere is how to set it up:\n\n\t\t@font-face {\n\t\t  font-family: "Open Sans";\n\t\t  src: url("/fonts/OpenSans-Regular-webfont.woff2") format("woff2"),\n\t\t       url("/fonts/OpenSans-Regular-webfont.woff") format("woff");\n\t\t}\n\n\t- We can apply any of the above using the following syntax in our style sheet:\n\n\t\tfont-family: \'Mulish\', sans-serif;\n',

              "Advantages\n\n    Sass facilitates you to write clean, easy and less CSS in a programming construct.\n    It contains fewer codes so you can write CSS quicker.\n    It is more stable, powerful, and elegant because it is an extension of CSS. So, it is easy for designers and developers to work more efficiently and quickly.\n    It is compatible with all versions of CSS. So, you can use any available CSS libraries.\n    It provides nesting so you can use nested syntax and useful functions like color manipulation, math functions and other values.\n\nDisadvantages\n\n    The developer must have enough time to learn new features present in this preprocessor before using it.\n    Using Sass may result in the loss of some benefits of a browser's built-in element inspector.",

            answer:
              "This addresses what happens when passing data from one variable to another. More specifically, this is about where variables point. \n\nThe original variable points to a place in memory. The new variable can either point to the same place in memory, which means the reference to the data was passed, or the new variable can point to a new place in memory that contains the same data, which means the values were passed to the new memory location.\n\nThe main reason this is important is shown by the results of changing either variable. If only a reference was passed, meaning both variables point to the same data at the same memory location, then changing a value will change change it for both variables, as well as any others pointing to the same place in memory.\n\nIf the actual values were passed and reside at a new location in memory, changing the values at the new memory location will only be visible with the new variable (and any others pointing to that location). The original variable is still pointing at the old memory location and remains unchanged.\n\nExamples:\nlet example1 = 1;\nlet example2 = example1;\nexample2++;\n\nconsole.log(example1, ' - ', example2);\n\nconst example3 = {\n  weapon: 'lightsaber'\n};\nconst example4 = {\n  ...example3\n};\nexample4.name = 'Darth Vader';\nconsole.log(example3, ' - ', example4);",

The offset does not affect the position of any other elements; thus, the space given for the element in the page layout is the same as if position were static. \n\nThis value creates a new stacking context when the value of z-index is not auto.

It is positioned relative to the initial containing block established by the viewport, except when one of its ancestors has a transform, perspective, or filter property set to something other than none (see the CSS Transforms Spec), in which case that ancestor behaves as the containing block. (Note that there are browser inconsistencies with perspective and filter contributing to containing block formation.) Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left. \n\nThis value always creates a new stacking context.

The offset does not affect the position of any other elements. \n\nThis value always creates a new stacking context. Note that a sticky element "sticks" to its nearest ancestor that has a "scrolling mechanism" (created when overflow is hidden, scroll, auto, or overlay), even if that ancestor isn\'t the nearest actually scrolling ancestor.

              "Here is a video introduction to hooks:\nhttps://youtu.be/dpw9EHDh2bM\n\n\nHooks let you use state and other React features without writing a class.\n\n\nExample of the useState hook:\n\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Example() {\n  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call \"count\"  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\n        Click me\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nA few snippets from https://softwareontheroad.com/react-hooks/\n\n\n When you work with Reactjs class components you can use state, that’s why these components are also called stateful, also every class component has lifecycle methods like: componentDidMount(), componentDidUpdate(), and so on.\n\nYou can’t use any of this in functional components. Functional components can’t use their own state and don’t have lifecycle methods.\n\nNow with React hooks you can.\n\nReact hooks allows us to take a Reactjs functional component and add state and lifecycle methods to it.\n\nIn simple words, React hooks are special functions to extend the capabilities of functional components and give them the possibility to have lifecycle events and manage state.\n\n\nThe existing React hooks 🍱\n\nThe new API comes with two main pre-existing hooks, and some others for other use cases\nBasics React hooks\n\nThe foundation of all React hooks, every other hook you will see is a variation of these three or are using them as primitives.\n\n    useState is the State hook use it for declaring the state in your components\n    useEffect is the Side effects hook use it for data fetching, manually changing the DOM, and etc.\n    useContext use it in conjunction with Reactjs Context API. When the React Context provider updates, this hook will trigger render with the latest context value.\n\nAdvance React hooks\n\nThese are the most important of the other built-in React hooks that come with the library.\n\n    The useReducer is an alternative to useState, you should use it when you have complex state logic, if you’re familiar with Redux you will like it.\n    The useRef use it for accessing a DOM element with a mutable ref object. Is more useful than the ref attribute\n\n\n\nRules\n\n    Never call Hooks from inside a loop, condition or nested function\n    Never call a Hook from a regular function\n    Only call them inside functions components or custom hooks\n    Hooks should sit at the top level of your component\n    Hooks can call other Hooks\n\n\n\n",

              "Comparing to see if two objects are not really just one referencing the other: Object.is(). This will tell us if one is really just a variable that was passed a reference to the original object, like with: const var1 = obj1; This is only a reference, so Object.is(var1, obj1) will equal true. If so, the values will always be identical.\n\nComparing unique objects can be a little more involved. There is a loose approach and a more strict approach. \n\nWe can test the number of entries in each, as a different number of entries would indicate they are different. We can do this by checking if one has more keys than the other using Object.keys().length or Object.getOwnPropertyNames().length.\nWhen iterating through the objects, we must also account for the possibility of nested arrays and/or objects. These might even go many levels deep.\n\nOne way is to turn both objects into strings using JSON.stringify() and then compare the strings. This will ONLY work if we know the keys will always be IN THE SAME ORDER. When using this method, any variance, like a key being in a different place, will cause the comparison to fail even though the values might be identical.\n\nA more strict approach is to iterate through each object and check the key-value pair against the other. This will work even if the keys are not in the same order. \n\n\nconst user1 = {\n  first: 'Lando',\n  last: 'Calrissian'\n};\nconst user2 = {\n  first: 'Lando',\n  last: 'Calrissian'\n};\n\n\n// Direct comparison\nconsole.log(user1 === user2);  // false\n\n// Stringify process\nconst stringObj1 = JSON.stringify(user1);\nconst stringObj2 = JSON.stringify(user2);\n\nconsole.log(typeof stringObj1);  // string\nconsole.log(stringObj1 === stringObj2);  // true\n\n\n\n// Iterating process possibiltiy\nfunction isSameObject (obj1, obj2) {\n  const props1 = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj1);\n  const props2 = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj2);\n\n  if (props1.length !== props2.length) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < props1.length; i++) {\n    const property = props1[i];\n\n    if (props1[property] !== props2[property]) {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return true;\n}\n\nconsole.log(isSameObject(user1, user2));  // true",

            answer:
              "A pseudo-element in CSS is similar to a pseudo-class in that it uses a keyword added to a selector, but he similarities end there. CSS pseudo-elements let us style a specific part of elements or even add to the beginning or end of the element. In addition, a pseudo-element will use double colons between the keyword and the selector. Technically, because this double-colon convention was not in place early on, the spec still allows this. That said, it is still expected that double colons are used.\n\n\nA few examples:\n\n::after - This creates an inline pseudo-element as the lst child of an element.\n\n::before - Similar to the above, this creates an inline pseudo-element as the first child of an element.\n\n::first-letter - This will apply styles to the first letter of the first line of an element.\n\n::first-line - This works like ::first-letter, but the style will apply to the whole line. What qualifies for the first line will depend on the width of the element, font size and other similar factors.\n\n::selection - When the user highlights a section, usually by clicking and dragging the mouse across text, we can style this highlighted area using the ::selection pseudo-element.\n\n\nDrop this example into an online editor, like https://codepen.io/pen/, to see a few of the pseudo-elements work their magic:\n\nCSS\n\tp::first-letter {\n\t\tfont-size: 50px;\n\t}\n\n\tp::first-line {\n\t\tcolor: orange;\n\t\tletter-spacing: 0.5em;\n\t}\n\n\tp::before {\n\t\tcontent: 'THIS IS BEFORE ---- ';\n\t\tcolor: darkblue;\n\t\tbackground-color: yellowgreen;\n\t}\n\n\tp::after {\n\t\tcontent: '--- THIS IS AFTER';\n\t\tbackground: gray;\n\t\tcolor: aquamarine;\n\t}\n\n\nHTML\n\t<p>The first line will be orange and have letter-spacing applied. The first line changes as the element size changes. The resat of the line will be black, except for the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements. \n\t</p>\n\n",

              "A Promise is basically a placeholder for the results of a request. We can then use handlers based on the eventual success or failure of the request. Promises allow values to be returned much like synchronous methods, just not immediately. In the interim, the Promise, acting as the placeholder, allow the program to move on and will then provide the results of the request whenever they are ready.\n\nA Promise is always either:\n\n    pending: This is the default state. No value is ready nor has anything been rejected.\n    fulfilled: This means the request was completed successfully and the results will be returned.\n    rejected: As it sounds, the operation failed. This will return a reason for the rejection.\n\nA few approaches to handle the results of Promises, we can either chain then() methods with a catch() or use Async/Await. Note: If using Async/Await, it is a good idea to wrap it in a try-catch block to handle a possible rejection.",

            answer:
              'From Wikipedia:\n\nIn computing, tree shaking is a dead code elimination technique that is applied when optimizing code written in ECMAScript dialects like Dart, JavaScript, or TypeScript into a single bundle that is loaded by a web browser. Rather than eliminating code that can never be executed, tree shaking starts from entry point and includes only the code that is guaranteed to be executed.[1] It is succinctly described as "live code inclusion".\nHistory\n\nDead code elimination in dynamic languages is a much harder problem than in static languages. The idea of a "treeshaker" originated in LISP[2] in the 1990s. The idea is that all possible execution flows of a program can be represented as a tree of function calls, so that functions that are never called can be eliminated.\n\nThe algorithm was applied to JavaScript in Google Closure Tools and then to Dart in the dart2js compiler also written by Google, presented by Bob Nystrom in 2012[3][4] and described by the book "Dart in Action" by author Chris Buckett in 2013:\n\n    When code is converted from Dart to JavaScript the compiler does \'tree shaking\'. In JavaScript you have to add an entire library even if you only need it for one function, but thanks to tree shaking the Dart-derived JavaScript only includes the individual functions that you need from a library\n    — Chris Buckett\n\nThe next wave of popularity of the term is attributed to Rich Harris\'s Rollup project[5] developed in 2015.\nRelation to ECMAScript 6 modules\n\nThe popularity of tree shaking in JavaScript is based on the fact that in distinction from CommonJS modules, ECMAScript 6 module loading is static and thus the whole dependency tree can be deduced by statically parsing the syntax tree. Thus tree shaking becomes an easy problem. However, tree shaking does not only apply at the import/export level: it can also work at the statement level, depending on the implementation.[citation needed] ',

              "A clip from:\nhttps://www.katalon.com/resources-center/blog/ci-cd-introduction/\n\n\nCI/CD is the acronym for the combined practices of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). CI/CD practices are currently the most widely accepted choice to shorten software development and delivery cycle time.\n\n\nWhat is Continuous Integration?\n\nIn a CI practice, developers build, run, and test code on their own workstations before committing code to the version control repository. After changes are made to the repository, a chain of events is put into motion. A typical first step in this chain is to build the latest version of source code. If the build is successful, unit tests are executed. If unit testing succeeds, the build is deployed to test environments where system tests are performed (usually using automated tests). The team is notified about the status of this process, and a report is delivered to provide details, such as build number, defects, and the number of tests.\n\n\nWhat is Continuous Delivery?\n\nCD makes it possible to release builds to the production environment when needed. Allowing the team to deploy at will, CD effectively reduces time to market.\n\nBefore deploying software to production, the CD process includes performing automated system testing, unit testing (including API testing and load testing), and integration testing. The steps from CI to CD are usually completed automatically, including automated testing at the unit, integration, and system levels. As tests can fail at any level and environment, CI/CD must include a feedback channel to quickly report failures to developers.",

It is unlikely anyone would speak ill of themselves, but stumbling through or throwing out a bunch of catch phrases like "I am a hard worker" without any detail can be telling. If we take pride in what we do, how we do it and how we treat others, we should be proud enough to talk about it.\n\nUltimately, we just need to give a brief bit of detail about why something about us or our work is good. "I am a hard worker" followed up with how teammates always know, perhaps even commented, that we would get the job done and meet deadlines. Perhaps a bit about how some colleagues have become good friends. Maybe a little highlighting of how a boss liked to throw complicated or new things at us because he or she knew how well we can handle ourselves. This will all, of course, be personal and unique, but the general idea is just to showcase the positive affects that our personality, work ethic and passion have had on the people we worked with and the companies we worked for.\n\n\n',

              'Prior to semantic elements in HTML5, we would use the generic "div" tag and then use more descriptive ID\'s or classes. For example, a navigation menu might be <div id="nav" ></div>. With HTML5, we became able to use a "nav" tag, or "footer" tag and many more. This makes our template more descriptive and easier to follow, which are always goals when working towards clean code.\n\n\nHere are a few of the descriptive tags available:\n\n    <nav></nav>\n\n    <header></header>\n\n    <main>\n        <article></article>\n        <section></section>\n    </main>\n\n    <aside></aside>\n\n    <footer></footer>',

              'This question is sometimes asked because it is more of an intermediate to advanced topic, given that it deals with both how things are layered, how an element\'s parent affects this and how the position property setting can change things.\n\n\tHere are the basics to know:\n\t- z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky).\n\n\t- Elements usually stack with the items that are lower in the DOM appearing on top. z-index can change that for an element using a integer. The higher the number, the higher it goes on the element stack.\n\n\t- Understanding how the parent-child relationship works is very important for understanding how z-index will affect the elements. If element A has children, but element B sits on top of it, then no child element A can ever be higher than element B. No matter how high we make the z-index setting. \n\n\t- You can animate z-index, but it is either behind or in front of an element. It will not transition from one to the other. \n\n\tAn example that can be dropped into an online editor like https://codepen.io/pen/ :\n\n\n\t\tCSS\n\t\t\tdiv {\n\t\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\t\tbackground: black;\n\t\t\tcolor: white;\n\t\t\twidth: 100%;\n\t\t\ttop: 35%;\n\t\t\ttext-align: center;\n\t\t\tpadding: 1em\n\t\t}\n\n\t\timg {\n\t\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\t\tleft: 25%;\n\t\t\ttop: 0;\n\t\t\tz-index: -1;\n\t\t\tmargin: 0 auto;\n\t\t}\n\n\n\t\tHTML\n\t\t    <div><h1>Toggle the image\'s z-index property to watch it go backwards and forwards.</h1>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random" width="50%">\n',

Due to the difficulty in retrofitting CSP into existing websites, CSP is mandatory for all new websites and is strongly recommended for all existing high-risk sites.\n\nThe primary benefit of CSP comes from disabling the use of unsafe inline JavaScript.

[1] A/B tests consist of a randomized experiment with two variants, A and B.[2][3] It includes application of statistical hypothesis testing or "two-sample hypothesis testing" as used in the field of statistics. A/B testing is a way to compare two versions of a single variable, typically by testing a subject\'s response to variant A against variant B, and determining which of the two variants is more effective.[4] \n\n\nHere is a nice excerpt from this article:\nhttps://crossbrowsertesting.com/blog/visual-testing/ab-testing-screenshots/\n\n"One of the more common testing practices that marketers experiment with is A/B testing, which lets you test two scenarios at once to determine which your audience responds to better. This is done by having control and variable scenarios, which are randomly displayed to users when they visit your site.\n\nThese changes can be as small as testing the color of a CTA button to seeing whether adding a video on a landing page will increase registrations. For example, one user may see a green “Sign Up Now” button, while the other sees a red one. During an A/B test, you may look to see which one gets more clicks in order to inform which color you want to set the button to."\n\nA/B testing tools from a list complied in:\nhttps://www.ventureharbour.com/best-a-b-testing-tools/\n\nGoogle Analytics & Google Optimize - Free\nOptimizely\nVWO\nZoho PageSense\nHubSpot\nLeadformly\nUnbounce\nConvertize\nKameleoon\nConvert\n',

            question: "",
            answer:
              'A very complete answer from:\nhttps://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-create-a-multicolor-text-in-html-and-css.html\n\nYou can create a multicolor text with the help of image editors such as Pixelmator, Photoshop and so on. So, you can create a multicolor image and embed it into your website.\nThe multicolor text will not be searchable with this method.\n\nAs a result, your code will look like the following:\n\n<img src="multicolortext.png"/>\n\nMake separate elements¶\n\nAnother way is creating a text with separate elements by using the HTML <span> tag, which is an empty container. This means that you create a multicolor text by putting each letter in a separate element to define a different color for each letter of your text.\nExample of creating a multicolor text with separate elements in HTML:¶\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Title of the document</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <span style="color:#FF0000">H</span>\n    <span style="color:#66CC66">e</span>\n    <span style="color:#FF9966">l</span>\n    <span style="color:#FFCCCC">l</span>\n    <span style="color:#FF0066">o</span>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\nTry it Yourself »\nResult¶\nUse CSS¶\n\nAnd finally, you can use CSS. This is the easiest way of creating such kind of text.\n\nPut your text in a <span> tag and give it a class name "multicolortext". Then, you need the CSS background-image property to add a gradient background to your text with its "linear-gradient" value, where you put the names of your preferred colors.\n\nTo get multicolor text instead of the multicolor background, you need to use the background-clip property, which lets you control how far a background image or color extends beyond the element\'s padding or content. This step gives some colors to your text, but not exactly what you want.\n\nYou can get the final result by making your text color transparent with the color property so that the background color will be reflected in the text.\nExample of creating a multicolor text with HTML and CSS:¶\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>The title of the document</title>\n    <style>\n      .multicolortext {\n        background-image: linear-gradient(to left, violet, indigo, green, blue, yellow, orange, red);\n        -webkit-background-clip: text;\n        -moz-background-clip: text;\n        background-clip: text;\n        color: transparent;\n      }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>\n      <span class="multicolortext">Let’s be creative!</span>\n    </h1>\n  </body>\n</html>',

Adding to this with third-party API's experience, like the Braintree API, or Slack API, can help showcase real-world experience.\n\n\n\nA few options are:\n\t- Geolocations\n\n\t\t        if (navigator.geolocation) {\n\t\t            navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((pos) => {\n\t\t                console.log('Got Location', pos);\n\t\t            }, () => {\n\t\t                console.log('nope')\n\t\t            });\n\t\t        }\n\n\n\n- Media API: This API works for both audio and video. There are a number of methods including play() and pause() as well as load().\n\n- Text Track API: Picking up where the Media API leaves off, the Text Track API allows us to interact with text tracks (subtitles or captions) for the audio and videos.\n\n- Drag and Drop: There are a number of possibilities with this API. Among these, you can add  'draggable' attribute to allow a user to move an element then have event handlers in place on a drop zone so the browser knows where the element can be dropped.\n\n- History API: This spec gives developers more control of the user's browser session. Along with moving the the user forward or backward, we can check the length of the history and even add or remove entries. We can hold data enabling us to restore a page or just update the URL without refreshing the page.\n",

              'Accessibility has become a very big focus for many companies. Knowing they are hiring people that can support this effort is important. The goal for an answer to any question about accessibility is to show that we have a basic understanding combined with being able to about real-world use.\n\nAccessibility is no longer just something nice to incorporate, it is essential for making sure people, best practices and, in some cases, laws are being respected. \n\nA few accessibility features we can incorporate:\n\nThoughtful contrasting colors for people who have trouble seeing color. This allows them to see a difference between two colored areas.\n\nAria labels are important for signalling correct detail to screen readers.\n\nUsing tags instead of CSS properties, like <em> instead of font-weight, will signal to screen-readers the intent to emphasis. This can then be past along to the user.\nThere are tools available, like Lighthouse now included in Chrome Dev Tools, that can run scans and alert us to accessibility concerns.\n\n\nHere is an example of the <em> and an aria label:\n\n\n    <p>Hi my name is Sheev Palpatine, but you can call me <em>EMPORER DARTH SIDIOUS</em></p>\n\n    <button aria-label="Close Modal">Close</button>',

HTTP2 adds a number of features to manage the streams, but leaves old semantics untouched.\n\n\nHTTP/2 supports queries multiplexing, headers compression, priority and more intelligent packet streaming management.

We just need to give a brief reasoning that includes our thoughts surrounding big moves, our steps to work with our current employer before making th e moves and how those decisions ended up being good or, perhaps, lessons that we learned from those that did not.\n\nUltimately, we don't want to lie or give the impression we are trying to cover anything up. There are always reasons and many of them are good reasons. Taking advantage of opportunities for personal or professional advancement are definitely good reasons. On the other side, some reasons are lessons that are part of our growth.\n",

            answer:
              "This question is designed to see our thought process on this issue.\n\nHere are some basic steps for approaching a slow app:\n\n\t1. Define the specific problem. What, specifically is slow? Is the initial load slow? Are page transitions slow? Do the interactions, like menu animations, seem slow or choppy? Does this occur on only some browsers or devices? \n\n\t\tUltimately, the goal here is to get as clear a picture as possible as of each part that is slow. This enables us to find the best spots to begin drilling down.\n\n\t2. Narrow the scope: Next we want to take our drill-down points and begin to narrow each of those to as small a piece of code as we can. \n\n\t\tFor instance, if the issue is slow loading, a good place to start is either Chrome Dev Tools' Lighthouse tool or a page speed analyzer. One popular one is: \n\n\t\thttps://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/\n\n\t\tThese tools can help see where it is slow, like the first paint or how long until a user can actually interact with the page. From there it can help us pinpoint potential problem areas, like large images or slow server response.\n\n\t\tin a browser's dev tools we can use other tools, like the Network section to see detail on specific items like when they loaded, how long they took and if they were blocking progress. \n\n\t\tIf the issue is something not related to resources loading, dev tools can help narrow down the search using the Debugger, Performance, Inspector, Console and others. \n\n\t3. Isolate: Once we gained an understanding of the specific symptoms and then narrowed the scope of our attention, we can now address these specific areas of code. Dev tools Debugger can be great for stepping through JavaScript. The Performance tool can help see how an animation affects the page processing. \n\n\t\tIf need be, it can help to isolate specific blocks of code in a separate editor, perhaps even an online editor like repl.it, codepen.io or jsbin.com. This can help zero-in on specific problems in the code.\n\t\tAlong the same line of thinking, commenting out blocks of code and/or temporarily inserting new simplified code can help ensure we have properly identified the problem area.\n\n\t4. Fix: By this point, we have arrived at the problem pieces of code. Now, we just need to correct the issue.\n\n\t5. Test...a lot: We have not fixed the problem at this point. We have only written the code that we think will correct the issue. Test. Test. Test then take a break...test again. At that point, we have fixed teh issue.",

              'There are a wide array of strategies for this answer. Below are a few basic approaches, though a web search (click the "More About this Question" button for that) will yield a wealth of detail and other options.\n\n- We can just give an amount we would like to make and we think we are worth. it is simple and direct, though it might be a factor in eliminating us from the candidate list if the number far exceeds what the company wants to spend on the position or thinks we are worth. This approach is not concerned with staying in market value. It is more about weeding out companies that can not or do not wish to pay what we value our services at. \n\n- We can take our current salary and just raise that a little. Assuming we are applying for a similar position, or even slightly elevated, this keeps us around market range. \n\n- If the job is meant to be an entry into a new career, pushing for more money might hurt the greater purpose. We might want to consider looking for the salary range listed in the job post and speaking to an amount towards the middle, with a minimum around the listed minimum. Or, perhaps, if our situation is one where little more or less would not matter and getting in the door is the focus, being honest about this can be OK. It would be best to also ask how soon someone is eligible for a raise and to make sure they do not offer below their posted minimum. There are some who would say never ask for or imply the offered minimum, but getting the first foot in can make a tremendous difference and then enable us to make the next interview about what we are really worth.\n\n- Use online tools to find a market salary range and then ask for a salary somewhere between the average and the top salary depending on where our skills and experience put us.\n\n\n\tA few tools for finding market value:\n\n\t\tGlassDoor: https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/index.htm\n\t\tPayScale: https://www.payscale.com/my/survey/choose\n\t\tLinkedin Salary Tool: https://www.linkedin.com/salary/',

              'This answer comes from:\nhttps://resource-centre.net/html5-tutorials/bullet-point-lists/\n\nBullet Point Lists (or Unordered Lists)\n\nThe first kind of list we will look at is using bullets.\nUnordered List – the <ul> Tag\n\nBullet point lists are also known as unordered lists (UL) because there is no numbering involved. That is why a bulleted list uses the <ul> </ul> tag pair. Here is a basic example:\n\nThe whole list is surrounded by <ul> </ul> for a start. When you open your list tag, make sure you automatically type your closing tag and then proceed to fill your items between them.\nThe type Attribute\n\nThe type attribute determines what kind of bullet you are seeing on the page. Although through CSS you can specify a wide-range of bullet styles, and even use your own image, in raw HTML it is best to stick with the common types which are\n\n    type="circle" – an unfilled circle\n\n    type="disc" – a filled circle\n\n    type="square" – a filled square\n\nList Items – the <li> Tag\n\nEach individual item in your list is wrapped in its own <li> </li> tag pair. You can often get away without the </li> but I would recommend keeping it in, just so you maintain healthy coding habit.\n\nThe list above I placed in individual <ul> but each <li> also supports the type attribute, such that I could create\n\n    Square\n    Disc\n    Circle\n\nNot sure why you would want to do that, but you can if you want to!\n\nBullet List Indentation\n\nBefore you apply any CSS to your list, HTML (or more accurately, your browser) will apply indentation to your list, so it stands out from your normal paragraph <p> tags.\nOrdered / Numbered Lists – the <ol> Tag\n\nIf you want to present your list in an ordered fashion, then the <ol> tag is your friend. By default this will give you a numbered list, but the type attribute gives you flexibility, in the same way as bullet point lists do.\n\nwhich outputs\n\n    Item 1\n    Item 2\n    Item 3\n\nThe type attribute offers a few more options in ordered lists compared to bulleted ones. A bit more guidance on this can be obtained at W3Schools.\nStarting an Ordered List On A Different Number\n\nSay you were putting together some instructions to build a table. You may want to use a numbered list to achieve this. However, if you wanted to put images and extra text between each stage, you would probably need multiple lists. The problem is that each list starts at number 1 (or letter A) by default. That would screw up your instructions!\n\nThankfully HTML has the start property to allow you to start on a subsequent number:\n\nThis outputs:\n\n    Step Four\n    Step Five\n    Step Six\n\nReversing The Order\n\nIf you want to show your numbers (or letters) in reverse order, then this is really easy too. You might want to do a ‘Top 10’ with your best item announced last, for example. This can be done by adding the word reversed into your Ordered List opening tag:\n\nAnd this would make your list look like this:\n\n    First LI\n    Second LI\n    Third LI\n    Fourth LI\n    Fifth LI\n\nMulti-Level Bullet List in HTML\n\nWith patchy browser support (and sometimes undone by CSS in some sites) you can create a multilevel list. This is achieved by embedding one list inside another:\n\nWhich creates:\n\n    Top Level Item\n        Sub-Item 1\n        Sub-Item 2\n    Top Level Item\n\nYou can use a combination of <ul> and <ol>. That may be useful if you want bullet points under a numbered list.\n\n    Top Level Item\n        Sub-Item 1\n        Sub-Item 2\n    Top Level Item\n',

In either case, we need to work into the interview an example or two that showcases our ability to work with others. Overall, we want to exhibit good communication skills, and a brief bit about how important we think communication skills are when working with teams, or our superiors, the client, etc can help. Perhaps even a story about a time when kept our calm when others did not, or an example of how we set aside things that bothered us, and were able to generate harmony that helped move a project forward. All of this needs to be delivered, like all of our answers, with good eye contact without staring, enthusiasm married with a calm and thoughtful approach and general good will and respectful manner. These qualities can mean a lot to a company and can raise our profile above others in the eyes of the interviewer.\n",

              'The following excerpt come from bitofco.de:\nhttps://bitsofco.de/understanding-the-virtual-dom/\n\nWhy do we need a virtual DOM?\n\nTo understand why the concept of the virtual DOM arose, let’s revisit the original DOM. As I mentioned, there are two parts to the DOM - the object-based representation of the HTML document and the API to manipulating that object.\n\nFor example, let’s take this simple HTML document with an unordered list and one list item.\n\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang="en">\n <head></head>\n <body>\n    <ul class="list">\n        <li class="list__item">List item</li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\n\nThis document can be represented as the following DOM tree:\n\nhtml\nhead lang="en"\nbody\nul class="list"\nli class="list__item"\n"List item"\n\nLet’s say we want to modify the content of the first list item to \n"List item one"\n and also add a second list item. To do this, we will need use the DOM APIs to find the elements we want to update, create the new elements, add attributes and content, then finally update the DOM elements themselves.\n\nconst listItemOne = document.getElementsByClassName("list__item")[0];\nlistItemOne.textContent = "List item one";\n\nconst list = document.getElementsByClassName("list")[0];\nconst listItemTwo = document.createElement("li");\nlistItemTwo.classList.add("list__item");\nlistItemTwo.textContent = "List item two";\nlist.appendChild(listItemTwo);\n\nThe DOM wasn’t made for this…\n\nWhen the first specification for the DOM was released in 1998, we built and managed web pages in very differently. There was far less reliance on the DOM APIs to create and update the page content as frequently as we do today.\n\nSimple methods such as \ndocument.getElementsByClassName()\n are fine to use on a small scale, but if we are updating multiple elements on a page every few seconds, it can start to become really expensive to constantly query and update the DOM.\n\nEven further, because of the way the APIs are setup, it is usually simpler to perform more expensive operations where we update larger parts of the document than to find and update the specific elements. Going back to our list example, it is in some ways easier to replace the entire unordered list with a new one than to modify the specific elements.\n\nconst list = document.getElementsByClassName("list")[0];\nlist.innerHTML = `\n<li class="list__item">List item one</li>\n<li class="list__item">List item two</li>\n`;\n\n\nIn this particular example, the performance difference between the methods is probably insignificant. However, as the size of the web page grows, it becomes more important to only select and update what is needed.\n\n… but the virtual DOM was!\n\nThe virtual DOM was created to solve these problems of needing to frequently update the DOM in a more performant way. Unlike the DOM or the shadow DOM, the virtual DOM isn\'t an official specification, but rather a new method of interfacing with the DOM.\n\nA virtual DOM can be thought of as a copy of the original DOM. This copy can be frequently manipulated and updated, without using the DOM APIs. Once all the updates have been made to the virtual DOM, we can look at what specific changes need to be made to the original DOM and make them in a targetted and optimised way.',

Our goal is to show that we not only have dealt with conflict but that we have thought about it and worked through the difficult aspects. The worst thing we can do is not have an answer, or say we have never encountered any conflict. That is not realistic and it leaves the question wide open as to what they can expect from us if we encounter conflict while working there. Even a story about how we handled conflict poorly is fine, as long as we can talk clearly about how we thought and felt at the time and how we eventually learned how to handle it all better. \n\nTo put it simply:\n\tBe human. \n\tShow growth. \n\tShow thought. \n\tShow intent to understand others, even if they are acting poorly. \n\tShow a desire to explore the finer points of human interaction.\n\tShow that all of the above maters enough to have carefully thought about it.\n",

Led by Web inventor and Director Tim Berners-Lee and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe, W3C\'s mission is to lead the Web to its full potential.\n\n\nWhat does W3C do?\n\nW3C\'s primary activity is to develop protocols and guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the Web. W3C\'s standards define key parts of what makes the World Wide Web work. Learn more about W3C\'s mission.\nWhere is W3C located?\n\nW3C does not have a single physical headquarters. There are four institutions, however, that "host" W3C: MIT (in Cambridge, MA, USA), ERCIM (in Sophia-Antipolis, France), Keio University (near Tokyo, Japan), and Beihang University (in Beijing, China).\n\nThe W3C staff is distributed around the world, but there are concentrations of people in Cambridge, Massachusetts (USA), Sophia-Antipolis (France), and Tokyo (Japan). In addition, W3C is represented in 17 other regions of the world via representatives based at organizations. W3C calls these regional points of contact "W3C Offices."\nHow is W3C funded?\n\nW3C receives funds from:\n\n    W3C Member dues\n    Research grants and other sources of private and public funding\n    Individual donations of money and equipment \n\nWhat is the difference between the Web and the Internet?\n\nFrom the definition in the Wikipedia: "The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that interchange data by packet switching using the standardized Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)."\n\nThus, the Internet is a network of networks, defined by the TPC/IP standards.\n\nThe Web, on the other hand, is defined in W3C\'s Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume I as follows: "The World Wide Web (WWW, or simply Web) is an information space in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI)."\n\nThus, the Web is an information space.

              "Load balancing is simple technique for distributing workloads across multiple machines or clusters. The most common and simple load balancing algorithm is Round Robin. In this type of load balancing the request is divided in circular order ensuring all machines get equal number of requests and no single machine is overloaded or underloaded.\n\nThe Purpose of load balancing is to\n\nOptimize resource usage (avoid overload and under-load of any machines)\nAchieve Maximum Throughput\nMinimize response time\nMost common load balancing techniques in web based applications are\n\nRound robin\nSession affinity or sticky session\nIP Address affinity",

              "What is async, defer, preload and prefetch for loading JavaScript documents",
            answer:
              'All of this addresses the loading of documents and how they affect the main document.\n\nFrom:https://javascript.info/script-async-defer\n\n\nDEFER:\n\nThe defer attribute tells the browser not to wait for \nthe script. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, \nbuild DOM. The script loads “in the background”, and then runs when the \nDOM is fully built.\n\nHere’s the same example with defer:\n<p>...content before script...</p>\n\n<scrip/t defer src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js?speed=1"></scrip/t>\n\n<!-- visible immediately -->\n<p>...content after script...</p>\n\n\nIn other words:\n\n    - Scripts with defer never block the page.\n    - Scripts with defer always execute when the DOM is ready (but before DOMContentLoaded event).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASYNC\n\nThe async attribute is somewhat like \ndefer. It also makes the script non-blocking. But it has important differences in the behavior.\n\nThe async attribute means that a script is completely independent:\n\n    - The browser doesn’t block on async scripts (like defer).\n    - Other scripts don’t wait for async scripts, and async scripts don’t wait for them.\n    - DOMContentLoaded and async scripts don’t wait for each other:\n        | DOMContentLoaded may happen both before an async script (if an async script finishes loading after the page is complete)\n        | …or after an async script (if an async script is short or was in HTTP-cache)\n\n    <p>...content before scripts...</p>\n\n    <scrip/t>\n      document.addEventListener(\'DOMContentLoaded\', () => alert("DOM ready!"));\n    </scrip/t>\n\n    <scrip/t async src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js"></scrip/t>\n    <scrip/t async src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/small.js"></scrip/t>\n\n    <p>...content after scripts...</p>\n\n\n\nThe following examples come from: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/html-preload-prefetch\n\n\n    \nPRELOAD\n\nPreloading JavaScript resources is done differently. This example, taken from this Google Developers article on preloading, shows this:\nindex.html\n\n<link rel="preload" href="used-later.js" as="scrip/t">\n<!-- ... -->\n<scrip/t>\n  var usedLaterScript = document.createElement(\'script\');\n  usedLaterScript.src = \'used-later.js\';\n  document.body.appendChild(usedLaterScript);\n</scrip/t>\n\n\n\nPREFETCH\n\nPrefetching works similarly to preloading. The difference is that, \nwhen prefetching a resource, the browser considers the resource to be \nlow priority. This means that the resource or asset will load a bit \nlater. Because of this, prefetching is usually implemented with \nresources that are not required initially, but are used at a later \npoint.\n\nTo implement prefectching in your HTML page, change the value of \nrel to "prefetching.\n\nindex.html\n<link\n  rel="prefetch"\n  as="style"\n  onload="this.rel = \'stylesheet\'"\n  href=\'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:100,900|Material+Icons\'>\n',

              'This is generally asked to get an idea of how much someone pays attention to good practices and, ultimately, will write easier to understand code and have an easier time jumping into someone else\'s code.\n\nGeneral naming conventions:\n-\tNames should be brief, but descriptive enough that the average non-developer could understand. For example, using "d = new Date()" might serve brevity, but can make no sense later in the program and require extra effort to understand. Conversely, "theDateForTheDayTheAppIsRun = new Date()" is clear, but unnecessarily long. Simply "todaysDate = new Date()" is brief and easily understood.\n\nA few JavaScript examples can be:\n- Camel case for variables: const lastName = \'Kenobi\'\n- Pascal case for classes: class MainCharacter { }\n- "is" or "has" prefix for booleans.\n- Function calls that will be returning something can start with have a descriptive verb ("update", "get", etc).\n- As few variables as possible. This is not really a naming convention, but it greatly affects the abilty for the names of the variables that do get used to be easier to follow and keep track of.\n- Do not re-use variable names.\n- In many cases it is better not to make a variable equal itself with modification. This can be difficult to follow through and can often be better served with a new, variable descriptively named to match the newly formed data.\n- When reasonable, if a specific item in an array is being used, assign a more descriptive variable: const updatedFileId = changes[0]\n- Property names that do not need to be prefixed with the class name. \n\tWe do not need: class Car {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructor(brand, purchaseDate) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.carName = brand;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.carYear = purchaseDate;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n} \n\tInstead, we can use: class Car {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructor(brand) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.name = brand;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.year = purchaseDate;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t} \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t// in use it will still be descriptive\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconst myCar = new Car();\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmyCar,name = \'Jeep\';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmyCar.year = \'2017\';\n- Avoid "magic" numbers, or numbers without a name, when possible. \n\tWe want to avoid: const forwardMovement = duration * 3;\n\tWe can use: const rate = 3;\n\t\t\t\t  forwardMovement = duration * rate;\n\t\t\t\t \n\nCSS & HTML examples:\n- Use nicely cascading rules to make for as few selectors as possible.\n- Kabab case for selectors: .inner-wrap\n- Descriptive selector names. This can be the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) method or similar.\n- Try to avoid using the same name for an ID and a class. These are technically independent from each other, but this can cause confusion for a developer.\n',

This is often not ideal, as we are generally better off knowing how many parameters we will be passing, but for the occasions where we do not, the Rest operator makes for a clean, readable and powerful tool.\n\n\nfunction sum(...theArgs) {\n  let total = 0;\n  for (const arg of theArgs) {\n    total += arg;\n  }\n  return total;\n}\n\nconsole.log(sum(1, 2, 3));\n// Expected output: 6\n\nconsole.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4));\n// Expected output: 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spread (...) syntax allows an iterable, such as an array or string, to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected. In an object literal, the spread syntax enumerates the properties of an object and adds the key-value pairs to the object being created.\n\nSpread syntax looks exactly like rest syntax. In a way, spread syntax is the opposite of rest syntax. Spread syntax "expands" an array into its elements, while rest syntax collects multiple elements and "condenses" them into a single element. See rest parameters and rest property.\n\nfunction sum(x, y, z) {\n\n  return x + y + z;\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3];\n\n\n\n\nconsole.log(sum(...numbers));\n\n// Expected output: 6\n\n\n\n\nconsole.log(sum.apply(null, numbers));\n\n// Expected output: 6\n\n\n',

              'This might sound like a silly question, but questions like this sometimes are used to get us to show our understanding of basic, but often needed, aspects of CSS. This will usually be a screening question, so a descriptive verbal outline will needed, not actual code.\n\nTo begin, we need to target our element via ID, or by class for multiple elements. We then want to set an equal width and height, perhaps 100px each. From there, we can either set the border for a few pixels or a background color or even both. This way we can see it. At that point, we have a square.\n\nMaking that square a circle simply requires a border-radius of 50% all of the way around. \n\nNow, that is a fixed width square or circle. We could make it responsive by using a percentage as the width and an equal percentage as padding-bottom. If there is content in the square or circle, one way to keep the sides equal would be to absolutely position the content. Ultimately, this is just an option. There are many ways to approach graphics in CSS, and purpose and the rest of the document will play into a plan for making the graphics responsive.\n\n\nPaste this example into an online editor, like https://codepen.io/pen/, to see the square and circle:\n\n\tCSS\n\t\t.square {\n\t\t\tbackground: lightgreen;\n\t\t\twidth: 50%;\n\t\t\tpadding-bottom: 50%;\n\t\t\tmargin: 0 auto;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t.square.circle {\n\t\t\tborder-radius: 50%;\n\t\t\tbackground: salmon;\n\t\t}\n\n\tHTML\n\t\t<div class="square"></div>\n\n\t\t<div class="square circle"></div>',

              "The days of great consideration being paid to Internet Explorer's many differences will, or possibly have, come to an end. This does not mean browser compatibility is no longer a concern. \nModern browsers are much more consistent with including features, but it is still good to check with a tool like https://caniuse.com/ or MDN to make sure new features are well covered.\n\nFor most browsers, we can easily download them and test our app. But what about older versions of each browser? What about these browsers on different devices. What if we need to test on Safari, but do not have access to a Mac? There are tools like https://www.browserstack.com/ to test web apps in many different ways. Some will even monitor real users on different browsers and devices. We can even have automated routines to test these scenarios.  \n\nBeyond testing, it is important that we know well what our target audience is going to be. If it is truly a global reach we are seeking, we need to consider things like Opera Mini (popular in parts of the world with slow internet), Baidu (a popular China-based browser), KaiOS' browser (mobile OS and browser used all over and especially in India) and any others that are used.\n\nAll of this does not mean that wide-reach intentions mean we need to remove most of our JavaScript just to make the app work right on Opera Mini. It just means just that we need to consider what happens to our product for the those users and work towards good solutions. \n\nWhithin any app, we should pay attention to current browser compatibility and utilize thinking along these lines:\n\n\t- We might just need to ensure there are fullbacks in place.\n\n\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\tposition: sticky; // Not fully supported by some browsers\n\n\t- We can plan our interactions and layouts so that nothing critical relies on technology not fully supported.\t\n\n\t- We can check for specific feature support in a browser and have separate functionality ready. This is not ideal as it requires extra consideration when maintaining the web app, but it is a workable solution.\n\n\t- We and the customer can consider the costs vs the gains related to supporting certain browsers. The benefits might not offset the costs of supporting a specific browser's use and/or the areas of the world it is popular.",

              'Some browsers accept additional proprietary non-standard non-css syntax on top of the usual css. Less is build on top of standard css and therefore may not recognize it. You may also need to put an otherwise non-parseable value inside a variable and use it to dynamically build selector or other css part during compilation time.\n\nEscaping allows you to use any arbitrary string as property or variable value. It can be used also to dynamically build selectors, but that feature is deprecated and replaced by different more powerful option.\n\nSyntax\n\nUse either ~"whatever" or ~\'whatever\' syntax to escape property values. Anything between quotes is used as is with almost no changes. The "as is" rule has one exception: string interpolation works with the usual @{variableName} syntax.\n\nUsed as Property Value\n\nSample input:\n\n@variable: "dynamic";\nh1 {\n  margin: 1 ~"2 2" 3;\n  padding: ~\'ms:special.syntax()\';\n  text: ~\'@{variable}\'; //interpolation works\n}\n\ncompiles into:\n\nh1 {\n  margin: 1 2 2 3;\n  padding: ms:special.syntax();\n  text: dynamic;\n}\n\n',

              "Excerpts from hacker.io:\n\nCSS was originally released in 1996 and consists of properties for adding font properties such as typeface and emphasis color of text, backgrounds, and other elements. CSS2 was released in 1998 with added styles for other media types so that it can be used for page layout designing. CSS3 was released in 1999 and presentation-style properties were added in it that allows you to build a presentation from documents.\n\nUnlike CSS2, which was comprised of a single document, CSS3 has its specifications divided into many individual modules, which makes CSS3 a whole lot easier to handle.\n\nWith CSS3, the designers can now use special fonts, like those available in Google Fonts and Typecast. Earlier, with CSS and CSS2, designers could only use “web-safe fonts” for being 100% sure to use fonts that would always display the same on every machine.\n\nWhile CSS and CSS2 had ‘simple selectors’, CSS3 calls the components as ‘a sequence of simple selectors’.\n\nCSS3 came up with some key web design considerations like rounded borders that help in rounding up the borders without any hassle. This turned out to be a huge plus point for developers who were struggling with initial versions of CSS borders.\n\nCSS3 has the capability to split text sections into multiple columns so that it can be read like a newspaper. In CSS2, the developers had difficulty because the standard was not equipped with automatically breaking the text so that it fits within a box.\n\n",

            answer:
              'Synchronous code runs from top to bottom in order. One line, command, function, etc is processed and resolved before moving to the next. This can be problematic if you encounter "blocking" code, which is code that causes processing one item for a longer amount of time. This means the rest of the program (and end user) wait until the program can mover on to the next line. This is where asynchronous code can be helpful.\n\nAsynchronous code runs separately from other code. This means it can take longer to process without "blocking" the rest of the program from running. In JavaScript, the Call Stack processes code synchronously. If a piece of asynchronous code is encountered, it is moved out of the Call Stack. If it is part of a Web API, like setTimeOut(), then the browser handles the resolving the code. Otherwise, it is moved to the Callback Que. In either case, the Event Loop will take the next item that has resolved, and place it on the Call Stack. This time, when the code can be dealt with in order because it is ready and will not block the processing the rest of the program.',

            level: "basic",
            answer:
              "Closure is an inner function, that is accessible outside of its parent function's scope while maintaining its connection to the parent's variables and other data. This can be don to keep some data private and purposely expose other data.\nTo accomplish this, an anonymous function can be immediately invoked. In this function, data we wish to keep  private can be processed. Usually this data would be removed from memory via JavaScript's \"garbage collection\" memory clearing process. If this function returns a function, let's call it a child function, that accesses data from the parent function, the parent's data will remain in memory. In this situation, the only access to the parent function's data will be via whatever had been set up in the child function. In addition, every time the child function is invoked, a new function scope is created for the child function. The parent function scope is only created once. This means that we can invoke the child function to change a variable in the parent and the next time we invoke the child function the variable in the parent will still reflect the change. \n\nThis can be considered state management and might not be as useful today given other options to manage state. Still, this process can be used to protect sensitive data or even just a to keep a counter variable from being accidentally increased.\n\nSome examples\n// For comparison, this is a counter without closure\nlet counter = 0;\n\nfunction add1 () {\n\tcounter++;\n\treturn counter;\n}\n\nconsole.log(add1());  // 1\nconsole.log(add1());  // 2\n// The counter becomes unpredictable when it can be altered elswhere\ncounter++;\nconsole.log(add1());  // 4\n\n\n// This is a counter with closure\nconst add1 = (function () {\n  let counter = 0;\n\n  return function () {\n\tcounter++;\n\treturn counter;\n  };\n})();\nconsole.log(add1());  // 1\nconsole.log(add1());  // 2\nconsole.log(add1());  // 3\ncounter++;// error: counter is not defined\nconsole.log(add1());\n\n// Another, more complex example\n// In this travelAgent() in the child function made available, while \n// the \"trip\" variable and agent() function are accessible through \n// travelAgent(). The book() function, is only accessible through agent().\nfunction vacation() {\n\tvar trip;\n\n\tfunction travelAgent(itinerary) {\n\t\tagent(itinerary);\n\t\treturn trip;\n\t}\n\n\tfunction agent(itinerary) {\n\t\tif (itinerary === 'Orlando') {\n\t\t\ttrip = ['Orlando', 'Disney', 'Universal'];\n\t\t\tbook();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tfunction book() {\n\t\ttrip.push('booked');\n\t}\n\treturn travelAgent;\n}\n\nvar myVacation = vacation();\n\nconsole.log(myVacation('Orlando'));\n\n// Array [ \"Orlando\", \"Disney\", \"Universal\", \"booked\" ]\n",

A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.\n\nO - Open-closed principle. Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.\n\nL - Liskov substitution principle. Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.\n\nI - Interface segregation principle. A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.\n\nD - Dependency Inversion Principle. Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.\n\nHere is a good article on the subject: https://dev.to/francescoxx/solid-principles-in-javascript-3pek\n",

The attack is possible thanks to HTML frames (iframes).\n\nIts other name, user interface (UI) redressing, better describes what is going on. Users think they are using a web page’s normal UI, but in fact there is a hidden UI in control; in other words, the UI has been redressed.

So, it is easy for designers and developers to work more efficiently and quickly.\n    It is compatible with all versions of CSS. So, you can use any available CSS libraries.\n    It provides nesting so you can use nested syntax and useful functions like color manipulation, math functions and other values.\n\nDisadvantages\n\n    The developer must have enough time to learn new features present in this preprocessor before using it.\n    Using Sass may result in the loss of some benefits of a browser's built-in element inspector.",

              "This addresses what happens when passing data from one variable to another. More specifically, this is about where variables point. \n\nThe original variable points to a place in memory. The new variable can either point to the same place in memory, which means the reference to the data was passed, or the new variable can point to a new place in memory that contains the same data, which means the values were passed to the new memory location.\n\nThe main reason this is important is shown by the results of changing either variable. If only a reference was passed, meaning both variables point to the same data at the same memory location, then changing a value will change change it for both variables, as well as any others pointing to the same place in memory.\n\nIf the actual values were passed and reside at a new location in memory, changing the values at the new memory location will only be visible with the new variable (and any others pointing to that location). The original variable is still pointing at the old memory location and remains unchanged.\n\nExamples:\nlet example1 = 1;\nlet example2 = example1;\nexample2++;\n\nconsole.log(example1, ' - ', example2);\n\nconst example3 = {\n  weapon: 'lightsaber'\n};\nconst example4 = {\n  ...example3\n};\nexample4.name = 'Darth Vader';\nconsole.log(example3, ' - ', example4);",

It is positioned relative to the initial containing block established by the viewport, except when one of its ancestors has a transform, perspective, or filter property set to something other than none (see the CSS Transforms Spec), in which case that ancestor behaves as the containing block. (Note that there are browser inconsistencies with perspective and filter contributing to containing block formation.)

The offset does not affect the position of any other elements. \n\nThis value always creates a new stacking context. Note that a sticky element "sticks" to its nearest ancestor that has a "scrolling mechanism" (created when overflow is hidden, scroll, auto, or overlay), even if that ancestor isn\'t the nearest actually scrolling ancestor.

              "Here is a video introduction to hooks:\nhttps://youtu.be/dpw9EHDh2bM\n\n\nHooks let you use state and other React features without writing a class.\n\n\nExample of the useState hook:\n\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Example() {\n  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call \"count\"  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\n        Click me\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nA few snippets from https://softwareontheroad.com/react-hooks/\n\n\n When you work with Reactjs class components you can use state, that’s why these components are also called stateful, also every class component has lifecycle methods like: componentDidMount(), componentDidUpdate(), and so on.\n\nYou can’t use any of this in functional components. Functional components can’t use their own state and don’t have lifecycle methods.\n\nNow with React hooks you can.\n\nReact hooks allows us to take a Reactjs functional component and add state and lifecycle methods to it.\n\nIn simple words, React hooks are special functions to extend the capabilities of functional components and give them the possibility to have lifecycle events and manage state.\n\n\nThe existing React hooks 🍱\n\nThe new API comes with two main pre-existing hooks, and some others for other use cases\nBasics React hooks\n\nThe foundation of all React hooks, every other hook you will see is a variation of these three or are using them as primitives.\n\n    useState is the State hook use it for declaring the state in your components\n    useEffect is the Side effects hook use it for data fetching, manually changing the DOM, and etc.\n    useContext use it in conjunction with Reactjs Context API. When the React Context provider updates, this hook will trigger render with the latest context value.\n\nAdvance React hooks\n\nThese are the most important of the other built-in React hooks that come with the library.\n\n    The useReducer is an alternative to useState, you should use it when you have complex state logic, if you’re familiar with Redux you will like it.\n    The useRef use it for accessing a DOM element with a mutable ref object. Is more useful than the ref attribute\n\n\n\nRules\n\n    Never call Hooks from inside a loop, condition or nested function\n    Never call a Hook from a regular function\n    Only call them inside functions components or custom hooks\n    Hooks should sit at the top level of your component\n    Hooks can call other Hooks\n\n\n\n",

              "Comparing to see if two objects are not really just one referencing the other: Object.is(). This will tell us if one is really just a variable that was passed a reference to the original object, like with: const var1 = obj1; This is only a reference, so Object.is(var1, obj1) will equal true. If so, the values will always be identical.\n\nComparing unique objects can be a little more involved. There is a loose approach and a more strict approach. \n\nWe can test the number of entries in each, as a different number of entries would indicate they are different. We can do this by checking if one has more keys than the other using Object.keys().length or Object.getOwnPropertyNames().length.\nWhen iterating through the objects, we must also account for the possibility of nested arrays and/or objects. These might even go many levels deep.\n\nOne way is to turn both objects into strings using JSON.stringify() and then compare the strings. This will ONLY work if we know the keys will always be IN THE SAME ORDER. When using this method, any variance, like a key being in a different place, will cause the comparison to fail even though the values might be identical.\n\nA more strict approach is to iterate through each object and check the key-value pair against the other. This will work even if the keys are not in the same order. \n\n\nconst user1 = {\n  first: 'Lando',\n  last: 'Calrissian'\n};\nconst user2 = {\n  first: 'Lando',\n  last: 'Calrissian'\n};\n\n\n// Direct comparison\nconsole.log(user1 === user2);  // false\n\n// Stringify process\nconst stringObj1 = JSON.stringify(user1);\nconst stringObj2 = JSON.stringify(user2);\n\nconsole.log(typeof stringObj1);  // string\nconsole.log(stringObj1 === stringObj2);  // true\n\n\n\n// Iterating process possibiltiy\nfunction isSameObject (obj1, obj2) {\n  const props1 = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj1);\n  const props2 = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj2);\n\n  if (props1.length !== props2.length) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < props1.length; i++) {\n    const property = props1[i];\n\n    if (props1[property] !== props2[property]) {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return true;\n}\n\nconsole.log(isSameObject(user1, user2));  // true",

            answer:
              "A pseudo-element in CSS is similar to a pseudo-class in that it uses a keyword added to a selector, but he similarities end there. CSS pseudo-elements let us style a specific part of elements or even add to the beginning or end of the element. In addition, a pseudo-element will use double colons between the keyword and the selector. Technically, because this double-colon convention was not in place early on, the spec still allows this. That said, it is still expected that double colons are used.\n\n\nA few examples:\n\n::after - This creates an inline pseudo-element as the lst child of an element.\n\n::before - Similar to the above, this creates an inline pseudo-element as the first child of an element.\n\n::first-letter - This will apply styles to the first letter of the first line of an element.\n\n::first-line - This works like ::first-letter, but the style will apply to the whole line. What qualifies for the first line will depend on the width of the element, font size and other similar factors.\n\n::selection - When the user highlights a section, usually by clicking and dragging the mouse across text, we can style this highlighted area using the ::selection pseudo-element.\n\n\nDrop this example into an online editor, like https://codepen.io/pen/, to see a few of the pseudo-elements work their magic:\n\nCSS\n\tp::first-letter {\n\t\tfont-size: 50px;\n\t}\n\n\tp::first-line {\n\t\tcolor: orange;\n\t\tletter-spacing: 0.5em;\n\t}\n\n\tp::before {\n\t\tcontent: 'THIS IS BEFORE ---- ';\n\t\tcolor: darkblue;\n\t\tbackground-color: yellowgreen;\n\t}\n\n\tp::after {\n\t\tcontent: '--- THIS IS AFTER';\n\t\tbackground: gray;\n\t\tcolor: aquamarine;\n\t}\n\n\nHTML\n\t<p>The first line will be orange and have letter-spacing applied. The first line changes as the element size changes. The resat of the line will be black, except for the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements. \n\t</p>\n\n",

          answer:
            "A Promise is basically a placeholder for the results of a request. We can then use handlers based on the eventual success or failure of the request. Promises allow values to be returned much like synchronous methods, just not immediately. In the interim, the Promise, acting as the placeholder, allow the program to move on and will then provide the results of the request whenever they are ready.\n\nA Promise is always either:\n\n    pending: This is the default state. No value is ready nor has anything been rejected.\n    fulfilled: This means the request was completed successfully and the results will be returned.\n    rejected: As it sounds, the operation failed. This will return a reason for the rejection.\n\nA few approaches to handle the results of Promises, we can either chain then() methods with a catch() or use Async/Await. Note: If using Async/Await, it is a good idea to wrap it in a try-catch block to handle a possible rejection.",

          answer:
            'From Wikipedia:\n\nIn computing, tree shaking is a dead code elimination technique that is applied when optimizing code written in ECMAScript dialects like Dart, JavaScript, or TypeScript into a single bundle that is loaded by a web browser. Rather than eliminating code that can never be executed, tree shaking starts from entry point and includes only the code that is guaranteed to be executed.[1] It is succinctly described as "live code inclusion".\nHistory\n\nDead code elimination in dynamic languages is a much harder problem than in static languages. The idea of a "treeshaker" originated in LISP[2] in the 1990s. The idea is that all possible execution flows of a program can be represented as a tree of function calls, so that functions that are never called can be eliminated.\n\nThe algorithm was applied to JavaScript in Google Closure Tools and then to Dart in the dart2js compiler also written by Google, presented by Bob Nystrom in 2012[3][4] and described by the book "Dart in Action" by author Chris Buckett in 2013:\n\n    When code is converted from Dart to JavaScript the compiler does \'tree shaking\'. In JavaScript you have to add an entire library even if you only need it for one function, but thanks to tree shaking the Dart-derived JavaScript only includes the individual functions that you need from a library\n    — Chris Buckett\n\nThe next wave of popularity of the term is attributed to Rich Harris\'s Rollup project[5] developed in 2015.\nRelation to ECMAScript 6 modules\n\nThe popularity of tree shaking in JavaScript is based on the fact that in distinction from CommonJS modules, ECMAScript 6 module loading is static and thus the whole dependency tree can be deduced by statically parsing the syntax tree. Thus tree shaking becomes an easy problem. However, tree shaking does not only apply at the import/export level: it can also work at the statement level, depending on the implementation.[citation needed] ',

            "A clip from:\nhttps://www.katalon.com/resources-center/blog/ci-cd-introduction/\n\n\nCI/CD is the acronym for the combined practices of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). CI/CD practices are currently the most widely accepted choice to shorten software development and delivery cycle time.\n\n\nWhat is Continuous Integration?\n\nIn a CI practice, developers build, run, and test code on their own workstations before committing code to the version control repository. After changes are made to the repository, a chain of events is put into motion. A typical first step in this chain is to build the latest version of source code. If the build is successful, unit tests are executed. If unit testing succeeds, the build is deployed to test environments where system tests are performed (usually using automated tests). The team is notified about the status of this process, and a report is delivered to provide details, such as build number, defects, and the number of tests.\n\n\nWhat is Continuous Delivery?\n\nCD makes it possible to release builds to the production environment when needed. Allowing the team to deploy at will, CD effectively reduces time to market.\n\nBefore deploying software to production, the CD process includes performing automated system testing, unit testing (including API testing and load testing), and integration testing. The steps from CI to CD are usually completed automatically, including automated testing at the unit, integration, and system levels. As tests can fail at any level and environment, CI/CD must include a feedback channel to quickly report failures to developers.",

If we take pride in what we do, how we do it and how we treat others, we should be proud enough to talk about it.\n\nUltimately, we just need to give a brief bit of detail about why something about us or our work is good. "I am a hard worker" followed up with how teammates always know, perhaps even commented, that we would get the job done and meet deadlines. Perhaps a bit about how some colleagues have become good friends. Maybe a little highlighting of how a boss liked to throw complicated or new things at us because he or she knew how well we can handle ourselves. This will all, of course, be personal and unique, but the general idea is just to showcase the positive affects that our personality, work ethic and passion have had on the people we worked with and the companies we worked for.\n\n\n',

            'Prior to semantic elements in HTML5, we would use the generic "div" tag and then use more descriptive ID\'s or classes. For example, a navigation menu might be <div id="nav" ></div>. With HTML5, we became able to use a "nav" tag, or "footer" tag and many more.

            'This question is sometimes asked because it is more of an intermediate to advanced topic, given that it deals with both how things are layered, how an element\'s parent affects this and how the position property setting can change things.\n\n\tHere are the basics to know:\n\t- z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky).\n\n\t- Elements usually stack with the items that are lower in the DOM appearing on top. z-index can change that for an element using a integer. The higher the number, the higher it goes on the element stack.\n\n\t- Understanding how the parent-child relationship works is very important for understanding how z-index will affect the elements. If element A has children, but element B sits on top of it, then no child element A can ever be higher than element B. No matter how high we make the z-index setting. \n\n\t- You can animate z-index, but it is either behind or in front of an element. It will not transition from one to the other. \n\n\tAn example that can be dropped into an online editor like https://codepen.io/pen/ :\n\n\n\t\tCSS\n\t\t\tdiv {\n\t\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\t\tbackground: black;\n\t\t\tcolor: white;\n\t\t\twidth: 100%;\n\t\t\ttop: 35%;\n\t\t\ttext-align: center;\n\t\t\tpadding: 1em\n\t\t}\n\n\t\timg {\n\t\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\t\tleft: 25%;\n\t\t\ttop: 0;\n\t\t\tz-index: -1;\n\t\t\tmargin: 0 auto;\n\t\t}\n\n\n\t\tHTML\n\t\t    <div><h1>Toggle the image\'s z-index property to watch it go backwards and forwards.</h1>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random" width="50%">\n',

Due to the difficulty in retrofitting CSP into existing websites, CSP is mandatory for all new websites and is strongly recommended for all existing high-risk sites.\n\nThe primary benefit of CSP comes from disabling the use of unsafe inline JavaScript. Inline JavaScript – either reflected or stored – means that improperly escaped user-inputs can generate code that is interpreted by the web browser as JavaScript.

[1] A/B tests consist of a randomized experiment with two variants, A and B.[2][3] It includes application of statistical hypothesis testing or "two-sample hypothesis testing" as used in the field of statistics. A/B testing is a way to compare two versions of a single variable, typically by testing a subject\'s response to variant A against variant B, and determining which of the two variants is more effective.[4] \n\n\nHere is a nice excerpt from this article:\nhttps://crossbrowsertesting.com/blog/visual-testing/ab-testing-screenshots/\n\n"One of the more common testing practices that marketers experiment with is A/B testing, which lets you test two scenarios at once to determine which your audience responds to better. This is done by having control and variable scenarios, which are randomly displayed to users when they visit your site.\n\nThese changes can be as small as testing the color of a CTA button to seeing whether adding a video on a landing page will increase registrations. For example, one user may see a green “Sign Up Now” button, while the other sees a red one. During an A/B test, you may look to see which one gets more clicks in order to inform which color you want to set the button to."\n\nA/B testing tools from a list complied in:\nhttps://www.ventureharbour.com/best-a-b-testing-tools/\n\nGoogle Analytics & Google Optimize - Free\nOptimizely\nVWO\nZoho PageSense\nHubSpot\nLeadformly\nUnbounce\nConvertize\nKameleoon\nConvert\n',

            'A very complete answer from:\nhttps://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-create-a-multicolor-text-in-html-and-css.html\n\nYou can create a multicolor text with the help of image editors such as Pixelmator, Photoshop and so on. So, you can create a multicolor image and embed it into your website.\nThe multicolor text will not be searchable with this method.\n\nAs a result, your code will look like the following:\n\n<img src="multicolortext.png"/>\n\nMake separate elements¶\n\nAnother way is creating a text with separate elements by using the HTML <span> tag, which is an empty container. This means that you create a multicolor text by putting each letter in a separate element to define a different color for each letter of your text.\nExample of creating a multicolor text with separate elements in HTML:¶\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Title of the document</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <span style="color:#FF0000">H</span>\n    <span style="color:#66CC66">e</span>\n    <span style="color:#FF9966">l</span>\n    <span style="color:#FFCCCC">l</span>\n    <span style="color:#FF0066">o</span>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\nTry it Yourself »\nResult¶\nUse CSS¶\n\nAnd finally, you can use CSS. This is the easiest way of creating such kind of text.\n\nPut your text in a <span> tag and give it a class name "multicolortext". Then, you need the CSS background-image property to add a gradient background to your text with its "linear-gradient" value, where you put the names of your preferred colors.\n\nTo get multicolor text instead of the multicolor background, you need to use the background-clip property, which lets you control how far a background image or color extends beyond the element\'s padding or content. This step gives some colors to your text, but not exactly what you want.\n\nYou can get the final result by making your text color transparent with the color property so that the background color will be reflected in the text.\nExample of creating a multicolor text with HTML and CSS:¶\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>The title of the document</title>\n    <style>\n      .multicolortext {\n        background-image: linear-gradient(to left, violet, indigo, green, blue, yellow, orange, red);\n        -webkit-background-clip: text;\n        -moz-background-clip: text;\n        background-clip: text;\n        color: transparent;\n      }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>\n      <span class="multicolortext">Let’s be creative!</span>\n    </h1>\n  </body>\n</html>',

            "This will always be asked, and it is a great opportunity for us to highlight our strengths and interests while getting insight into the company. \n\nThese questions can be anything and we definitely should ask about areas of concern or curiosity. In addition, below are some ideas to include.\n\nWhat code quality standards does the team follow? - This highlights that we care about code quality while giving us an idea of the company's focus.\n\n\tFollowing up this question based on their reply, we can ask:\n\t\t- What is the version control branching strategy..or do they use branches?\n\t\t- What kind of testing do they use? Unit tests? End-to-end tests?\n\t\t- Do they use any sort of feature-toggling?\n\t\t- Do they use continuous integration, continuous delivery or continuous deployment?\n\t\t\t(detail on those: https://tinyurl.com/ybty6fw3)\n\t\t- What is the QA process like?\n\nWhat project or team would I start on? - This shows we care about what we will be doing and who we will be doing it with. We can also see if the project interests us and, most importantly, if we are able to meet the team we are able to see if they seem happy. Even if only a a few names or the team lead's name is given, we might be able to do some research and find out about the people that might be our colleagues. \n\nWhy are you interested in hiring me? \n\n\t\t\t- OR -\n\nWhat are a few reasons you would hire me?\n\n\t- However it is asked, this is a good last question. The purpose is to get them thinking of why they would want to hire us. It also puts them on the spot to think about and say a few nice things about us. After the interview there will be a point when the decision makers will consider what they liked and what didn't grab them, but they will have already begun thinking about the good stuff before we even leave the room.\n\n\nThis last one is a statement instead of a question. We just got them thinking about why they would want to hire us, now we want to detail for them how we are perfect for this role.\n\n\tA few ideas for this:\n\t\t- Highlight the core technologies they use and our experience with them.\n\t\t- Our side projects and how we have continued learning.\n\t\t- Our passion for making teams work and helping other team members get better through solid communication, being calm and positive, mentoring when needed and keeping focused on solutions and goals instead of disagreements.\n\t\t- Anything that we feel we offer and, especially, what sets us apart. This is our final chance to sell ourselves. We need to make it count.",

This is an opportunity to drive home areas where the companies and our interests mesh nicely. In addition, knowing how we want to be better just one year from now can show a commitment to constant growth.\n- Give a brief outline of what your ideal professional self would be five years from now. Make it real and doable, but still a bit of a long reach. Unrealistic goals or extremely small goals are not going to help us look any better. High, but achievable, goals can be inspiring.\n- The five-year goals can include:\n\t\t- A higher understanding of certain principles.\n\t\t- More experience and deeper knowledge in one or two technologies (ideally ones that are associated with the job being considered).\n\t\t- A general increased role and professional status, like becoming a senior dev, leading a team or even entering into management.\n\t\t- One or two new languages, tools or processes that would build on the current ones (ideally meshing with what the company offers, if possible).\n\t\t- Certain experience within a team or some similar goal that relates to being even better working with others.\n\t\t- Conferences, talks, meetups, projects related to career path, etc.\n- Give a brief outline of what your ideal personal self would be five years from now. This can be anything at all and should definitely be genuine. Family life, personal project (writing a book, starting a group, etc), growing hobbies or adding new ones, physical fitness, etc.",

            "It is not necessary to know them all, but more to show a depth of understanding and familiarity with using a few. Adding to this with third-party API's experience, like the Braintree API, or Slack API, can help showcase real-world experience.\n\n\n\nA few options are:\n\t- Geolocations\n\n\t\t        if (navigator.geolocation) {\n\t\t            navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((pos) => {\n\t\t                console.log('Got Location', pos);\n\t\t            }, () => {\n\t\t                console.log('nope')\n\t\t            });\n\t\t        }\n\n\n\n- Media API: This API works for both audio and video. There are a number of methods including play() and pause() as well as load().\n\n- Text Track API: Picking up where the Media API leaves off, the Text Track API allows us to interact with text tracks (subtitles or captions) for the audio and videos.\n\n- Drag and Drop: There are a number of possibilities with this API. Among these, you can add  'draggable' attribute to allow a user to move an element then have event handlers in place on a drop zone so the browser knows where the element can be dropped.\n\n- History API: This spec gives developers more control of the user's browser session. Along with moving the the user forward or backward, we can check the length of the history and even add or remove entries. We can hold data enabling us to restore a page or just update the URL without refreshing the page.\n",

            'Accessibility has become a very big focus for many companies. Knowing they are hiring people that can support this effort is important. The goal for an answer to any question about accessibility is to show that we have a basic understanding combined with being able to about real-world use.\n\nAccessibility is no longer just something nice to incorporate, it is essential for making sure people, best practices and, in some cases, laws are being respected. \n\nA few accessibility features we can incorporate:\n\nThoughtful contrasting colors for people who have trouble seeing color. This allows them to see a difference between two colored areas.\n\nAria labels are important for signalling correct detail to screen readers.\n\nUsing tags instead of CSS properties, like <em> instead of font-weight, will signal to screen-readers the intent to emphasis. This can then be past along to the user.\nThere are tools available, like Lighthouse now included in Chrome Dev Tools, that can run scans and alert us to accessibility concerns.\n\n\nHere is an example of the <em> and an aria label:\n\n\n    <p>Hi my name is Sheev Palpatine, but you can call me <em>EMPORER DARTH SIDIOUS</em></p>\n\n    <button aria-label="Close Modal">Close</button>',

          answer:
            "This question is designed to see our thought process on this issue.\n\nHere are some basic steps for approaching a slow app:\n\n\t1. Define the specific problem. What, specifically is slow? Is the initial load slow? Are page transitions slow? Do the interactions, like menu animations, seem slow or choppy? Does this occur on only some browsers or devices? \n\n\t\tUltimately, the goal here is to get as clear a picture as possible as of each part that is slow. This enables us to find the best spots to begin drilling down.\n\n\t2. Narrow the scope: Next we want to take our drill-down points and begin to narrow each of those to as small a piece of code as we can. \n\n\t\tFor instance, if the issue is slow loading, a good place to start is either Chrome Dev Tools' Lighthouse tool or a page speed analyzer. One popular one is: \n\n\t\thttps://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/\n\n\t\tThese tools can help see where it is slow, like the first paint or how long until a user can actually interact with the page. From there it can help us pinpoint potential problem areas, like large images or slow server response.\n\n\t\tin a browser's dev tools we can use other tools, like the Network section to see detail on specific items like when they loaded, how long they took and if they were blocking progress. \n\n\t\tIf the issue is something not related to resources loading, dev tools can help narrow down the search using the Debugger, Performance, Inspector, Console and others. \n\n\t3. Isolate: Once we gained an understanding of the specific symptoms and then narrowed the scope of our attention, we can now address these specific areas of code. Dev tools Debugger can be great for stepping through JavaScript. The Performance tool can help see how an animation affects the page processing. \n\n\t\tIf need be, it can help to isolate specific blocks of code in a separate editor, perhaps even an online editor like repl.it, codepen.io or jsbin.com. This can help zero-in on specific problems in the code.\n\t\tAlong the same line of thinking, commenting out blocks of code and/or temporarily inserting new simplified code can help ensure we have properly identified the problem area.\n\n\t4. Fix: By this point, we have arrived at the problem pieces of code. Now, we just need to correct the issue.\n\n\t5. Test...a lot: We have not fixed the problem at this point. We have only written the code that we think will correct the issue. Test. Test. Test then take a break...test again. At that point, we have fixed teh issue.",

            'There are a wide array of strategies for this answer. Below are a few basic approaches, though a web search (click the "More About this Question" button for that) will yield a wealth of detail and other options.\n\n- We can just give an amount we would like to make and we think we are worth. it is simple and direct, though it might be a factor in eliminating us from the candidate list if the number far exceeds what the company wants to spend on the position or thinks we are worth. This approach is not concerned with staying in market value. It is more about weeding out companies that can not or do not wish to pay what we value our services at. \n\n- We can take our current salary and just raise that a little. Assuming we are applying for a similar position, or even slightly elevated, this keeps us around market range. \n\n- If the job is meant to be an entry into a new career, pushing for more money might hurt the greater purpose. We might want to consider looking for the salary range listed in the job post and speaking to an amount towards the middle, with a minimum around the listed minimum. Or, perhaps, if our situation is one where little more or less would not matter and getting in the door is the focus, being honest about this can be OK. It would be best to also ask how soon someone is eligible for a raise and to make sure they do not offer below their posted minimum. There are some who would say never ask for or imply the offered minimum, but getting the first foot in can make a tremendous difference and then enable us to make the next interview about what we are really worth.\n\n- Use online tools to find a market salary range and then ask for a salary somewhere between the average and the top salary depending on where our skills and experience put us.\n\n\n\tA few tools for finding market value:\n\n\t\tGlassDoor: https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/index.htm\n\t\tPayScale: https://www.payscale.com/my/survey/choose\n\t\tLinkedin Salary Tool: https://www.linkedin.com/salary/',

          answer:
            'This answer comes from:\nhttps://resource-centre.net/html5-tutorials/bullet-point-lists/\n\nBullet Point Lists (or Unordered Lists)\n\nThe first kind of list we will look at is using bullets.\nUnordered List – the <ul> Tag\n\nBullet point lists are also known as unordered lists (UL) because there is no numbering involved. That is why a bulleted list uses the <ul> </ul> tag pair. Here is a basic example:\n\nThe whole list is surrounded by <ul> </ul> for a start. When you open your list tag, make sure you automatically type your closing tag and then proceed to fill your items between them.\nThe type Attribute\n\nThe type attribute determines what kind of bullet you are seeing on the page. Although through CSS you can specify a wide-range of bullet styles, and even use your own image, in raw HTML it is best to stick with the common types which are\n\n    type="circle" – an unfilled circle\n\n    type="disc" – a filled circle\n\n    type="square" – a filled square\n\nList Items – the <li> Tag\n\nEach individual item in your list is wrapped in its own <li> </li> tag pair. You can often get away without the </li> but I would recommend keeping it in, just so you maintain healthy coding habit.\n\nThe list above I placed in individual <ul> but each <li> also supports the type attribute, such that I could create\n\n    Square\n    Disc\n    Circle\n\nNot sure why you would want to do that, but you can if you want to!\n\nBullet List Indentation\n\nBefore you apply any CSS to your list, HTML (or more accurately, your browser) will apply indentation to your list, so it stands out from your normal paragraph <p> tags.\nOrdered / Numbered Lists – the <ol> Tag\n\nIf you want to present your list in an ordered fashion, then the <ol> tag is your friend. By default this will give you a numbered list, but the type attribute gives you flexibility, in the same way as bullet point lists do.\n\nwhich outputs\n\n    Item 1\n    Item 2\n    Item 3\n\nThe type attribute offers a few more options in ordered lists compared to bulleted ones. A bit more guidance on this can be obtained at W3Schools.\nStarting an Ordered List On A Different Number\n\nSay you were putting together some instructions to build a table. You may want to use a numbered list to achieve this. However, if you wanted to put images and extra text between each stage, you would probably need multiple lists. The problem is that each list starts at number 1 (or letter A) by default. That would screw up your instructions!\n\nThankfully HTML has the start property to allow you to start on a subsequent number:\n\nThis outputs:\n\n    Step Four\n    Step Five\n    Step Six\n\nReversing The Order\n\nIf you want to show your numbers (or letters) in reverse order, then this is really easy too. You might want to do a ‘Top 10’ with your best item announced last, for example. This can be done by adding the word reversed into your Ordered List opening tag:\n\nAnd this would make your list look like this:\n\n    First LI\n    Second LI\n    Third LI\n    Fourth LI\n    Fifth LI\n\nMulti-Level Bullet List in HTML\n\nWith patchy browser support (and sometimes undone by CSS in some sites) you can create a multilevel list. This is achieved by embedding one list inside another:\n\nWhich creates:\n\n    Top Level Item\n        Sub-Item 1\n        Sub-Item 2\n    Top Level Item\n\nYou can use a combination of <ul> and <ol>. That may be useful if you want bullet points under a numbered list.\n\n    Top Level Item\n        Sub-Item 1\n        Sub-Item 2\n    Top Level Item\n',

In either case, we need to work into the interview an example or two that showcases our ability to work with others. Overall, we want to exhibit good communication skills, and a brief bit about how important we think communication skills are when working with teams, or our superiors, the client, etc can help. Perhaps even a story about a time when kept our calm when others did not, or an example of how we set aside things that bothered us, and were able to generate harmony that helped move a project forward. All of this needs to be delivered, like all of our answers, with good eye contact without staring, enthusiasm married with a calm and thoughtful approach and general good will and respectful manner. These qualities can mean a lot to a company and can raise our profile above others in the eyes of the interviewer.\n",

            'The following excerpt come from bitofco.de:\nhttps://bitsofco.de/understanding-the-virtual-dom/\n\nWhy do we need a virtual DOM?\n\nTo understand why the concept of the virtual DOM arose, let’s revisit the original DOM. As I mentioned, there are two parts to the DOM - the object-based representation of the HTML document and the API to manipulating that object.\n\nFor example, let’s take this simple HTML document with an unordered list and one list item.\n\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang="en">\n <head></head>\n <body>\n    <ul class="list">\n        <li class="list__item">List item</li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\n\nThis document can be represented as the following DOM tree:\n\nhtml\nhead lang="en"\nbody\nul class="list"\nli class="list__item"\n"List item"\n\nLet’s say we want to modify the content of the first list item to \n"List item one"\n and also add a second list item. To do this, we will need use the DOM APIs to find the elements we want to update, create the new elements, add attributes and content, then finally update the DOM elements themselves.\n\nconst listItemOne = document.getElementsByClassName("list__item")[0];\nlistItemOne.textContent = "List item one";\n\nconst list = document.getElementsByClassName("list")[0];\nconst listItemTwo = document.createElement("li");\nlistItemTwo.classList.add("list__item");\nlistItemTwo.textContent = "List item two";\nlist.appendChild(listItemTwo);\n\nThe DOM wasn’t made for this…\n\nWhen the first specification for the DOM was released in 1998, we built and managed web pages in very differently. There was far less reliance on the DOM APIs to create and update the page content as frequently as we do today.\n\nSimple methods such as \ndocument.getElementsByClassName()\n are fine to use on a small scale, but if we are updating multiple elements on a page every few seconds, it can start to become really expensive to constantly query and update the DOM.\n\nEven further, because of the way the APIs are setup, it is usually simpler to perform more expensive operations where we update larger parts of the document than to find and update the specific elements. Going back to our list example, it is in some ways easier to replace the entire unordered list with a new one than to modify the specific elements.\n\nconst list = document.getElementsByClassName("list")[0];\nlist.innerHTML = `\n<li class="list__item">List item one</li>\n<li class="list__item">List item two</li>\n`;\n\n\nIn this particular example, the performance difference between the methods is probably insignificant. However, as the size of the web page grows, it becomes more important to only select and update what is needed.\n\n… but the virtual DOM was!\n\nThe virtual DOM was created to solve these problems of needing to frequently update the DOM in a more performant way. Unlike the DOM or the shadow DOM, the virtual DOM isn\'t an official specification, but rather a new method of interfacing with the DOM.\n\nA virtual DOM can be thought of as a copy of the original DOM. This copy can be frequently manipulated and updated, without using the DOM APIs. Once all the updates have been made to the virtual DOM, we can look at what specific changes need to be made to the original DOM and make them in a targetted and optimised way.',

            'KISS, a backronym for "keep it simple, stupid", is a design principle noted by the U.S. Navy in 1960.

In the common case of HTML, the rendering engine parses HTML and CSS, and displays the parsed content on the screen.\n\n    Networking: network calls such as HTTP requests, using different implementations for different platform behind a platform-independent interface.\n\n    UI backend: This exposes a generic interface that is not platform specific. Underneath it uses operating system user interface methods all for drawing basic items like combo boxes and windows. \n\n    JavaScript interpreter: Used to parse and execute JavaScript code.\n\n    Data storage: The browser may need to save all sorts of data locally, such as cookies. Browsers also support storage mechanisms such as localStorage, IndexedDB, WebSQL and FileSystem.\n\nThe flow:\n\n           | <--------  USER INTERFACE\t\t\t\t________\nUI BACKEND |\t                 V\t\t\t\t\t     DATA\n           |            BROWSER ENGINE --------->  STORAGE\n           |                  V\t\t\t\t       ---------\n           | <------   RENDERING ENGINE\n                         V\t        V\t        \t\n                  NETWORKING   JAVASCRIPT INTERPRETER    \n",

            "This very basic question should prompt an easy and basic answer.  We just need to show we understand the general process.\n\n- We initiate a request using the domain name system with the URL as an address. \n- The server that houses the address will be located via the internet and the request is made.\n- The server then serves up the requested data.\n- The data is transferred via the web back to the browser.\n- \t\n\n\n- The web browser that you are using will contact a DNS (Domain Name System) server.\n- The DNS will translate the website name into a numeric IP address (every website domain name is basically an alias for an IP address). \n- The IP address is sent to the browser.\n- The browser uses this IP address to locate the server hosting the web page and, using the TCP protocol, opens a connection via port 80 on the server. In some cases, authentication can be part of this connection. This might be a JSON web token, or some other data, included in the request.\n- The server will then send the requested data to the browser.\n- The browser will then render the page to the screen. \n\n- The new web page might include dependencies, like CSS ot JavaScript sheets, or images, etc. The browser will then either request these via the same connection, or, if the begin the process for a new connection to retrieve each item.\n\n- Once the browser page (tab or window) is closed, the connection to the server ends.\n\n",

            'Excerpts from w3.org:\n\nThe World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community where Member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop Web standards. Led by Web inventor and Director Tim Berners-Lee and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe, W3C\'s mission is to lead the Web to its full potential.\n\n\nWhat does W3C do?\n\nW3C\'s primary activity is to develop protocols and guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the Web. W3C\'s standards define key parts of what makes the World Wide Web work. Learn more about W3C\'s mission.\nWhere is W3C located?\n\nW3C does not have a single physical headquarters. There are four institutions, however, that "host" W3C: MIT (in Cambridge, MA, USA), ERCIM (in Sophia-Antipolis, France), Keio University (near Tokyo, Japan), and Beihang University (in Beijing, China).\n\nThe W3C staff is distributed around the world, but there are concentrations of people in Cambridge, Massachusetts (USA), Sophia-Antipolis (France), and Tokyo (Japan). In addition, W3C is represented in 17 other regions of the world via representatives based at organizations. W3C calls these regional points of contact "W3C Offices."\nHow is W3C funded?\n\nW3C receives funds from:\n\n    W3C Member dues\n    Research grants and other sources of private and public funding\n    Individual donations of money and equipment \n\nWhat is the difference between the Web and the Internet?\n\nFrom the definition in the Wikipedia: "The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that interchange data by packet switching using the standardized Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)."\n\nThus, the Internet is a network of networks, defined by the TPC/IP standards.\n\nThe Web, on the other hand, is defined in W3C\'s Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume I as follows: "The World Wide Web (WWW, or simply Web) is an information space in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI)."\n\nThus, the Web is an information space. The first three specifications for Web technologies defined URLs, HTTP, and HTML.\n',

            "What is async, defer, preload and prefetch for loading JavaScript documents",
          answer:
            'All of this addresses the loading of documents and how they affect the main document.\n\nFrom:https://javascript.info/script-async-defer\n\n\nDEFER:\n\nThe defer attribute tells the browser not to wait for \nthe script. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, \nbuild DOM. The script loads “in the background”, and then runs when the \nDOM is fully built.\n\nHere’s the same example with defer:\n<p>...content before script...</p>\n\n<scrip/t defer src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js?speed=1"></scrip/t>\n\n<!-- visible immediately -->\n<p>...content after script...</p>\n\n\nIn other words:\n\n    - Scripts with defer never block the page.\n    - Scripts with defer always execute when the DOM is ready (but before DOMContentLoaded event).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASYNC\n\nThe async attribute is somewhat like \ndefer. It also makes the script non-blocking. But it has important differences in the behavior.\n\nThe async attribute means that a script is completely independent:\n\n    - The browser doesn’t block on async scripts (like defer).\n    - Other scripts don’t wait for async scripts, and async scripts don’t wait for them.\n    - DOMContentLoaded and async scripts don’t wait for each other:\n        | DOMContentLoaded may happen both before an async script (if an async script finishes loading after the page is complete)\n        | …or after an async script (if an async script is short or was in HTTP-cache)\n\n    <p>...content before scripts...</p>\n\n    <scrip/t>\n      document.addEventListener(\'DOMContentLoaded\', () => alert("DOM ready!"));\n    </scrip/t>\n\n    <scrip/t async src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js"></scrip/t>\n    <scrip/t async src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/small.js"></scrip/t>\n\n    <p>...content after scripts...</p>\n\n\n\nThe following examples come from: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/html-preload-prefetch\n\n\n    \nPRELOAD\n\nPreloading JavaScript resources is done differently. This example, taken from this Google Developers article on preloading, shows this:\nindex.html\n\n<link rel="preload" href="used-later.js" as="scrip/t">\n<!-- ... -->\n<scrip/t>\n  var usedLaterScript = document.createElement(\'script\');\n  usedLaterScript.src = \'used-later.js\';\n  document.body.appendChild(usedLaterScript);\n</scrip/t>\n\n\n\nPREFETCH\n\nPrefetching works similarly to preloading. The difference is that, \nwhen prefetching a resource, the browser considers the resource to be \nlow priority. This means that the resource or asset will load a bit \nlater. Because of this, prefetching is usually implemented with \nresources that are not required initially, but are used at a later \npoint.\n\nTo implement prefectching in your HTML page, change the value of \nrel to "prefetching.\n\nindex.html\n<link\n  rel="prefetch"\n  as="style"\n  onload="this.rel = \'stylesheet\'"\n  href=\'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:100,900|Material+Icons\'>\n',

            'This is generally asked to get an idea of how much someone pays attention to good practices and, ultimately, will write easier to understand code and have an easier time jumping into someone else\'s code.\n\nGeneral naming conventions:\n-\tNames should be brief, but descriptive enough that the average non-developer could understand. For example, using "d = new Date()" might serve brevity, but can make no sense later in the program and require extra effort to understand. Conversely, "theDateForTheDayTheAppIsRun = new Date()" is clear, but unnecessarily long. Simply "todaysDate = new Date()" is brief and easily understood.\n\nA few JavaScript examples can be:\n- Camel case for variables: const lastName = \'Kenobi\'\n- Pascal case for classes: class MainCharacter { }\n- "is" or "has" prefix for booleans.\n- Function calls that will be returning something can start with have a descriptive verb ("update", "get", etc).\n- As few variables as possible. This is not really a naming convention, but it greatly affects the abilty for the names of the variables that do get used to be easier to follow and keep track of.\n- Do not re-use variable names.\n- In many cases it is better not to make a variable equal itself with modification. This can be difficult to follow through and can often be better served with a new, variable descriptively named to match the newly formed data.\n- When reasonable, if a specific item in an array is being used, assign a more descriptive variable: const updatedFileId = changes[0]\n- Property names that do not need to be prefixed with the class name. \n\tWe do not need: class Car {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructor(brand, purchaseDate) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.carName = brand;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.carYear = purchaseDate;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n} \n\tInstead, we can use: class Car {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructor(brand) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.name = brand;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.year = purchaseDate;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t} \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t// in use it will still be descriptive\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconst myCar = new Car();\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmyCar,name = \'Jeep\';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmyCar.year = \'2017\';\n- Avoid "magic" numbers, or numbers without a name, when possible. \n\tWe want to avoid: const forwardMovement = duration * 3;\n\tWe can use: const rate = 3;\n\t\t\t\t  forwardMovement = duration * rate;\n\t\t\t\t \n\nCSS & HTML examples:\n- Use nicely cascading rules to make for as few selectors as possible.\n- Kabab case for selectors: .inner-wrap\n- Descriptive selector names. This can be the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) method or similar.\n- Try to avoid using the same name for an ID and a class. These are technically independent from each other, but this can cause confusion for a developer.\n',

This is often not ideal, as we are generally better off knowing how many parameters we will be passing, but for the occasions where we do not, the Rest operator makes for a clean, readable and powerful tool.\n\n\nfunction sum(...theArgs) {\n  let total = 0;\n  for (const arg of theArgs) {\n    total += arg;\n  }\n  return total;\n}\n\nconsole.log(sum(1, 2, 3));\n// Expected output: 6\n\nconsole.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4));\n// Expected output: 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spread (...) syntax allows an iterable, such as an array or string, to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected. In an object literal, the spread syntax enumerates the properties of an object and adds the key-value pairs to the object being created.\n\nSpread syntax looks exactly like rest syntax. In a way, spread syntax is the opposite of rest syntax. Spread syntax "expands" an array into its elements, while rest syntax collects multiple elements and "condenses" them into a single element. See rest parameters and rest property.\n\nfunction sum(x, y, z) {\n\n  return x + y + z;\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3];\n\n\n\n\nconsole.log(sum(...numbers));\n\n// Expected output: 6\n\n\n\n\nconsole.log(sum.apply(null, numbers));\n\n// Expected output: 6\n\n\n',

            'This might sound like a silly question, but questions like this sometimes are used to get us to show our understanding of basic, but often needed, aspects of CSS. This will usually be a screening question, so a descriptive verbal outline will needed, not actual code.\n\nTo begin, we need to target our element via ID, or by class for multiple elements. We then want to set an equal width and height, perhaps 100px each. From there, we can either set the border for a few pixels or a background color or even both. This way we can see it. At that point, we have a square.\n\nMaking that square a circle simply requires a border-radius of 50% all of the way around. \n\nNow, that is a fixed width square or circle. We could make it responsive by using a percentage as the width and an equal percentage as padding-bottom. If there is content in the square or circle, one way to keep the sides equal would be to absolutely position the content. Ultimately, this is just an option. There are many ways to approach graphics in CSS, and purpose and the rest of the document will play into a plan for making the graphics responsive.\n\n\nPaste this example into an online editor, like https://codepen.io/pen/, to see the square and circle:\n\n\tCSS\n\t\t.square {\n\t\t\tbackground: lightgreen;\n\t\t\twidth: 50%;\n\t\t\tpadding-bottom: 50%;\n\t\t\tmargin: 0 auto;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t.square.circle {\n\t\t\tborder-radius: 50%;\n\t\t\tbackground: salmon;\n\t\t}\n\n\tHTML\n\t\t<div class="square"></div>\n\n\t\t<div class="square circle"></div>',

            "The days of great consideration being paid to Internet Explorer's many differences will, or possibly have, come to an end. This does not mean browser compatibility is no longer a concern. \nModern browsers are much more consistent with including features, but it is still good to check with a tool like https://caniuse.com/ or MDN to make sure new features are well covered.\n\nFor most browsers, we can easily download them and test our app. But what about older versions of each browser? What about these browsers on different devices. What if we need to test on Safari, but do not have access to a Mac? There are tools like https://www.browserstack.com/ to test web apps in many different ways. Some will even monitor real users on different browsers and devices. We can even have automated routines to test these scenarios.  \n\nBeyond testing, it is important that we know well what our target audience is going to be. If it is truly a global reach we are seeking, we need to consider things like Opera Mini (popular in parts of the world with slow internet), Baidu (a popular China-based browser), KaiOS' browser (mobile OS and browser used all over and especially in India) and any others that are used.\n\nAll of this does not mean that wide-reach intentions mean we need to remove most of our JavaScript just to make the app work right on Opera Mini. It just means just that we need to consider what happens to our product for the those users and work towards good solutions. \n\nWhithin any app, we should pay attention to current browser compatibility and utilize thinking along these lines:\n\n\t- We might just need to ensure there are fullbacks in place.\n\n\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\tposition: sticky; // Not fully supported by some browsers\n\n\t- We can plan our interactions and layouts so that nothing critical relies on technology not fully supported.\t\n\n\t- We can check for specific feature support in a browser and have separate functionality ready. This is not ideal as it requires extra consideration when maintaining the web app, but it is a workable solution.\n\n\t- We and the customer can consider the costs vs the gains related to supporting certain browsers. The benefits might not offset the costs of supporting a specific browser's use and/or the areas of the world it is popular.",

            'Some browsers accept additional proprietary non-standard non-css syntax on top of the usual css. Less is build on top of standard css and therefore may not recognize it. You may also need to put an otherwise non-parseable value inside a variable and use it to dynamically build selector or other css part during compilation time.\n\nEscaping allows you to use any arbitrary string as property or variable value. It can be used also to dynamically build selectors, but that feature is deprecated and replaced by different more powerful option.\n\nSyntax\n\nUse either ~"whatever" or ~\'whatever\' syntax to escape property values. Anything between quotes is used as is with almost no changes. The "as is" rule has one exception: string interpolation works with the usual @{variableName} syntax.\n\nUsed as Property Value\n\nSample input:\n\n@variable: "dynamic";\nh1 {\n  margin: 1 ~"2 2" 3;\n  padding: ~\'ms:special.syntax()\';\n  text: ~\'@{variable}\'; //interpolation works\n}\n\ncompiles into:\n\nh1 {\n  margin: 1 2 2 3;\n  padding: ms:special.syntax();\n  text: dynamic;\n}\n\n',

            "Excerpts from hacker.io:\n\nCSS was originally released in 1996 and consists of properties for adding font properties such as typeface and emphasis color of text, backgrounds, and other elements. CSS2 was released in 1998 with added styles for other media types so that it can be used for page layout designing. CSS3 was released in 1999 and presentation-style properties were added in it that allows you to build a presentation from documents.\n\nUnlike CSS2, which was comprised of a single document, CSS3 has its specifications divided into many individual modules, which makes CSS3 a whole lot easier to handle.\n\nWith CSS3, the designers can now use special fonts, like those available in Google Fonts and Typecast. Earlier, with CSS and CSS2, designers could only use “web-safe fonts” for being 100% sure to use fonts that would always display the same on every machine.\n\nWhile CSS and CSS2 had ‘simple selectors’, CSS3 calls the components as ‘a sequence of simple selectors’.\n\nCSS3 came up with some key web design considerations like rounded borders that help in rounding up the borders without any hassle. This turned out to be a huge plus point for developers who were struggling with initial versions of CSS borders.\n\nCSS3 has the capability to split text sections into multiple columns so that it can be read like a newspaper. In CSS2, the developers had difficulty because the standard was not equipped with automatically breaking the text so that it fits within a box.\n\n",

          answer:
            'Synchronous code runs from top to bottom in order. One line, command, function, etc is processed and resolved before moving to the next. This can be problematic if you encounter "blocking" code, which is code that causes processing one item for a longer amount of time. This means the rest of the program (and end user) wait until the program can mover on to the next line. This is where asynchronous code can be helpful.\n\nAsynchronous code runs separately from other code. This means it can take longer to process without "blocking" the rest of the program from running. In JavaScript, the Call Stack processes code synchronously. If a piece of asynchronous code is encountered, it is moved out of the Call Stack. If it is part of a Web API, like setTimeOut(), then the browser handles the resolving the code. Otherwise, it is moved to the Callback Que. In either case, the Event Loop will take the next item that has resolved, and place it on the Call Stack. This time, when the code can be dealt with in order because it is ready and will not block the processing the rest of the program.',

Vertical gives a feeling of balance, formality and alertness. Oblique suggests movement and action    \n\n\nSIZE – Size is simply the relationship of the area occupied by one shape to that of another.    \n\n\nTEXTURE – Texture is the surface quality of a shape – rough, smooth, soft hard glossy etc.    \n\n\nCOLOR – Color is light reflected off objects.

          level: "basic",
          answer:
            "Closure is an inner function, that is accessible outside of its parent function's scope while maintaining its connection to the parent's variables and other data. This can be don to keep some data private and purposely expose other data.\nTo accomplish this, an anonymous function can be immediately invoked. In this function, data we wish to keep  private can be processed. Usually this data would be removed from memory via JavaScript's \"garbage collection\" memory clearing process. If this function returns a function, let's call it a child function, that accesses data from the parent function, the parent's data will remain in memory. In this situation, the only access to the parent function's data will be via whatever had been set up in the child function. In addition, every time the child function is invoked, a new function scope is created for the child function. The parent function scope is only created once. This means that we can invoke the child function to change a variable in the parent and the next time we invoke the child function the variable in the parent will still reflect the change. \n\nThis can be considered state management and might not be as useful today given other options to manage state. Still, this process can be used to protect sensitive data or even just a to keep a counter variable from being accidentally increased.\n\nSome examples\n// For comparison, this is a counter without closure\nlet counter = 0;\n\nfunction add1 () {\n\tcounter++;\n\treturn counter;\n}\n\nconsole.log(add1());  // 1\nconsole.log(add1());  // 2\n// The counter becomes unpredictable when it can be altered elswhere\ncounter++;\nconsole.log(add1());  // 4\n\n\n// This is a counter with closure\nconst add1 = (function () {\n  let counter = 0;\n\n  return function () {\n\tcounter++;\n\treturn counter;\n  };\n})();\nconsole.log(add1());  // 1\nconsole.log(add1());  // 2\nconsole.log(add1());  // 3\ncounter++;// error: counter is not defined\nconsole.log(add1());\n\n// Another, more complex example\n// In this travelAgent() in the child function made available, while \n// the \"trip\" variable and agent() function are accessible through \n// travelAgent(). The book() function, is only accessible through agent().\nfunction vacation() {\n\tvar trip;\n\n\tfunction travelAgent(itinerary) {\n\t\tagent(itinerary);\n\t\treturn trip;\n\t}\n\n\tfunction agent(itinerary) {\n\t\tif (itinerary === 'Orlando') {\n\t\t\ttrip = ['Orlando', 'Disney', 'Universal'];\n\t\t\tbook();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tfunction book() {\n\t\ttrip.push('booked');\n\t}\n\treturn travelAgent;\n}\n\nvar myVacation = vacation();\n\nconsole.log(myVacation('Orlando'));\n\n// Array [ \"Orlando\", \"Disney\", \"Universal\", \"booked\" ]\n",

A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.\n\nO - Open-closed principle. Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.\n\nL - Liskov substitution principle. Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.\n\nI - Interface segregation principle. A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.\n\nD - Dependency Inversion Principle. Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.\n\nHere is a good article on the subject: https://dev.to/francescoxx/solid-principles-in-javascript-3pek\n",

            "ClickJacking is an attack that fools users into thinking they are clicking on one thing when they are actually clicking on another. The attack is possible thanks to HTML frames (iframes).\n\nIts other name, user interface (UI) redressing, better describes what is going on. Users think they are using a web page’s normal UI, but in fact there is a hidden UI in control; in other words, the UI has been redressed. When users click something they think is safe, the hidden UI performs a different action.",

So, it is easy for designers and developers to work more efficiently and quickly.\n    It is compatible with all versions of CSS. So, you can use any available CSS libraries.\n    It provides nesting so you can use nested syntax and useful functions like color manipulation, math functions and other values.\n\nDisadvantages\n\n    The developer must have enough time to learn new features present in this preprocessor before using it.\n    Using Sass may result in the loss of some benefits of a browser's built-in element inspector.",

            "This addresses what happens when passing data from one variable to another. More specifically, this is about where variables point. \n\nThe original variable points to a place in memory. The new variable can either point to the same place in memory, which means the reference to the data was passed, or the new variable can point to a new place in memory that contains the same data, which means the values were passed to the new memory location.\n\nThe main reason this is important is shown by the results of changing either variable. If only a reference was passed, meaning both variables point to the same data at the same memory location, then changing a value will change change it for both variables, as well as any others pointing to the same place in memory.\n\nIf the actual values were passed and reside at a new location in memory, changing the values at the new memory location will only be visible with the new variable (and any others pointing to that location). The original variable is still pointing at the old memory location and remains unchanged.\n\nExamples:\nlet example1 = 1;\nlet example2 = example1;\nexample2++;\n\nconsole.log(example1, ' - ', example2);\n\nconst example3 = {\n  weapon: 'lightsaber'\n};\nconst example4 = {\n  ...example3\n};\nexample4.name = 'Darth Vader';\nconsole.log(example3, ' - ', example4);",

The offset does not affect the position of any other elements; thus, the space given for the element in the page layout is the same as if position were static. \n\nThis value creates a new stacking context when the value of z-index is not auto. Its effect on table-*-group, table-row, table-column, table-cell, and table-caption elements is undefined. \n\nabsolute \n\nThe element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor, if any; otherwise, it is placed relative to the initial containing block.

It is positioned relative to the initial containing block established by the viewport, except when one of its ancestors has a transform, perspective, or filter property set to something other than none (see the CSS Transforms Spec), in which case that ancestor behaves as the containing block. (Note that there are browser inconsistencies with perspective and filter contributing to containing block formation.) Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left. \n\nThis value always creates a new stacking context. In printed documents, the element is placed in the same position on every page. \n\nsticky \n\nThe element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor and containing block (nearest block-level ancestor), including table-related elements, based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the position of any other elements. \n\nThis value always creates a new stacking context. Note that a sticky element "sticks" to its nearest ancestor that has a "scrolling mechanism" (created when overflow is hidden, scroll, auto, or overlay), even if that ancestor isn\'t the nearest actually scrolling ancestor. This effectively inhibits any "sticky" behavior (see the GitHub issue on W3C CSSWG). \n\n ',

          answer:
            "Here is a video introduction to hooks:\nhttps://youtu.be/dpw9EHDh2bM\n\n\nHooks let you use state and other React features without writing a class.\n\n\nExample of the useState hook:\n\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Example() {\n  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call \"count\"  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\n        Click me\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nA few snippets from https://softwareontheroad.com/react-hooks/\n\n\n When you work with Reactjs class components you can use state, that’s why these components are also called stateful, also every class component has lifecycle methods like: componentDidMount(), componentDidUpdate(), and so on.\n\nYou can’t use any of this in functional components. Functional components can’t use their own state and don’t have lifecycle methods.\n\nNow with React hooks you can.\n\nReact hooks allows us to take a Reactjs functional component and add state and lifecycle methods to it.\n\nIn simple words, React hooks are special functions to extend the capabilities of functional components and give them the possibility to have lifecycle events and manage state.\n\n\nThe existing React hooks 🍱\n\nThe new API comes with two main pre-existing hooks, and some others for other use cases\nBasics React hooks\n\nThe foundation of all React hooks, every other hook you will see is a variation of these three or are using them as primitives.\n\n    useState is the State hook use it for declaring the state in your components\n    useEffect is the Side effects hook use it for data fetching, manually changing the DOM, and etc.\n    useContext use it in conjunction with Reactjs Context API. When the React Context provider updates, this hook will trigger render with the latest context value.\n\nAdvance React hooks\n\nThese are the most important of the other built-in React hooks that come with the library.\n\n    The useReducer is an alternative to useState, you should use it when you have complex state logic, if you’re familiar with Redux you will like it.\n    The useRef use it for accessing a DOM element with a mutable ref object. Is more useful than the ref attribute\n\n\n\nRules\n\n    Never call Hooks from inside a loop, condition or nested function\n    Never call a Hook from a regular function\n    Only call them inside functions components or custom hooks\n    Hooks should sit at the top level of your component\n    Hooks can call other Hooks\n\n\n\n",

            "Comparing to see if two objects are not really just one referencing the other: Object.is(). This will tell us if one is really just a variable that was passed a reference to the original object, like with: const var1 = obj1; This is only a reference, so Object.is(var1, obj1) will equal true. If so, the values will always be identical.\n\nComparing unique objects can be a little more involved. There is a loose approach and a more strict approach. \n\nWe can test the number of entries in each, as a different number of entries would indicate they are different. We can do this by checking if one has more keys than the other using Object.keys().length or Object.getOwnPropertyNames().length.\nWhen iterating through the objects, we must also account for the possibility of nested arrays and/or objects. These might even go many levels deep.\n\nOne way is to turn both objects into strings using JSON.stringify() and then compare the strings. This will ONLY work if we know the keys will always be IN THE SAME ORDER. When using this method, any variance, like a key being in a different place, will cause the comparison to fail even though the values might be identical.\n\nA more strict approach is to iterate through each object and check the key-value pair against the other. This will work even if the keys are not in the same order. \n\n\nconst user1 = {\n  first: 'Lando',\n  last: 'Calrissian'\n};\nconst user2 = {\n  first: 'Lando',\n  last: 'Calrissian'\n};\n\n\n// Direct comparison\nconsole.log(user1 === user2);  // false\n\n// Stringify process\nconst stringObj1 = JSON.stringify(user1);\nconst stringObj2 = JSON.stringify(user2);\n\nconsole.log(typeof stringObj1);  // string\nconsole.log(stringObj1 === stringObj2);  // true\n\n\n\n// Iterating process possibiltiy\nfunction isSameObject (obj1, obj2) {\n  const props1 = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj1);\n  const props2 = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj2);\n\n  if (props1.length !== props2.length) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < props1.length; i++) {\n    const property = props1[i];\n\n    if (props1[property] !== props2[property]) {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return true;\n}\n\nconsole.log(isSameObject(user1, user2));  // true",

            "A pseudo-element in CSS is similar to a pseudo-class in that it uses a keyword added to a selector, but he similarities end there. CSS pseudo-elements let us style a specific part of elements or even add to the beginning or end of the element. In addition, a pseudo-element will use double colons between the keyword and the selector. Technically, because this double-colon convention was not in place early on, the spec still allows this. That said, it is still expected that double colons are used.\n\n\nA few examples:\n\n::after - This creates an inline pseudo-element as the lst child of an element.\n\n::before - Similar to the above, this creates an inline pseudo-element as the first child of an element.\n\n::first-letter - This will apply styles to the first letter of the first line of an element.\n\n::first-line - This works like ::first-letter, but the style will apply to the whole line. What qualifies for the first line will depend on the width of the element, font size and other similar factors.\n\n::selection - When the user highlights a section, usually by clicking and dragging the mouse across text, we can style this highlighted area using the ::selection pseudo-element.\n\n\nDrop this example into an online editor, like https://codepen.io/pen/, to see a few of the pseudo-elements work their magic:\n\nCSS\n\tp::first-letter {\n\t\tfont-size: 50px;\n\t}\n\n\tp::first-line {\n\t\tcolor: orange;\n\t\tletter-spacing: 0.5em;\n\t}\n\n\tp::before {\n\t\tcontent: 'THIS IS BEFORE ---- ';\n\t\tcolor: darkblue;\n\t\tbackground-color: yellowgreen;\n\t}\n\n\tp::after {\n\t\tcontent: '--- THIS IS AFTER';\n\t\tbackground: gray;\n\t\tcolor: aquamarine;\n\t}\n\n\nHTML\n\t<p>The first line will be orange and have letter-spacing applied. The first line changes as the element size changes. The resat of the line will be black, except for the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements. \n\t</p>\n\n",

          answer:
            "A Promise is basically a placeholder for the results of a request. We can then use handlers based on the eventual success or failure of the request. Promises allow values to be returned much like synchronous methods, just not immediately. In the interim, the Promise, acting as the placeholder, allow the program to move on and will then provide the results of the request whenever they are ready.\n\nA Promise is always either:\n\n    pending: This is the default state. No value is ready nor has anything been rejected.\n    fulfilled: This means the request was completed successfully and the results will be returned.\n    rejected: As it sounds, the operation failed. This will return a reason for the rejection.\n\nA few approaches to handle the results of Promises, we can either chain then() methods with a catch() or use Async/Await. Note: If using Async/Await, it is a good idea to wrap it in a try-catch block to handle a possible rejection.",

          answer:
            'From Wikipedia:\n\nIn computing, tree shaking is a dead code elimination technique that is applied when optimizing code written in ECMAScript dialects like Dart, JavaScript, or TypeScript into a single bundle that is loaded by a web browser. Rather than eliminating code that can never be executed, tree shaking starts from entry point and includes only the code that is guaranteed to be executed.[1] It is succinctly described as "live code inclusion".\nHistory\n\nDead code elimination in dynamic languages is a much harder problem than in static languages. The idea of a "treeshaker" originated in LISP[2] in the 1990s. The idea is that all possible execution flows of a program can be represented as a tree of function calls, so that functions that are never called can be eliminated.\n\nThe algorithm was applied to JavaScript in Google Closure Tools and then to Dart in the dart2js compiler also written by Google, presented by Bob Nystrom in 2012[3][4] and described by the book "Dart in Action" by author Chris Buckett in 2013:\n\n    When code is converted from Dart to JavaScript the compiler does \'tree shaking\'. In JavaScript you have to add an entire library even if you only need it for one function, but thanks to tree shaking the Dart-derived JavaScript only includes the individual functions that you need from a library\n    — Chris Buckett\n\nThe next wave of popularity of the term is attributed to Rich Harris\'s Rollup project[5] developed in 2015.\nRelation to ECMAScript 6 modules\n\nThe popularity of tree shaking in JavaScript is based on the fact that in distinction from CommonJS modules, ECMAScript 6 module loading is static and thus the whole dependency tree can be deduced by statically parsing the syntax tree. Thus tree shaking becomes an easy problem. However, tree shaking does not only apply at the import/export level: it can also work at the statement level, depending on the implementation.[citation needed] ',

            "A clip from:\nhttps://www.katalon.com/resources-center/blog/ci-cd-introduction/\n\n\nCI/CD is the acronym for the combined practices of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). CI/CD practices are currently the most widely accepted choice to shorten software development and delivery cycle time.\n\n\nWhat is Continuous Integration?\n\nIn a CI practice, developers build, run, and test code on their own workstations before committing code to the version control repository. After changes are made to the repository, a chain of events is put into motion. A typical first step in this chain is to build the latest version of source code. If the build is successful, unit tests are executed. If unit testing succeeds, the build is deployed to test environments where system tests are performed (usually using automated tests). The team is notified about the status of this process, and a report is delivered to provide details, such as build number, defects, and the number of tests.\n\n\nWhat is Continuous Delivery?\n\nCD makes it possible to release builds to the production environment when needed. Allowing the team to deploy at will, CD effectively reduces time to market.\n\nBefore deploying software to production, the CD process includes performing automated system testing, unit testing (including API testing and load testing), and integration testing. The steps from CI to CD are usually completed automatically, including automated testing at the unit, integration, and system levels. As tests can fail at any level and environment, CI/CD must include a feedback channel to quickly report failures to developers.",

"I am a hard worker" followed up with how teammates always know, perhaps even commented, that we would get the job done and meet deadlines. Perhaps a bit about how some colleagues have become good friends. Maybe a little highlighting of how a boss liked to throw complicated or new things at us because he or she knew how well we can handle ourselves. This will all, of course, be personal and unique, but the general idea is just to showcase the positive affects that our personality, work ethic and passion have had on the people we worked with and the companies we worked for.\n\n\n',

            'This question is sometimes asked because it is more of an intermediate to advanced topic, given that it deals with both how things are layered, how an element\'s parent affects this and how the position property setting can change things.\n\n\tHere are the basics to know:\n\t- z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky).\n\n\t- Elements usually stack with the items that are lower in the DOM appearing on top. z-index can change that for an element using a integer. The higher the number, the higher it goes on the element stack.\n\n\t- Understanding how the parent-child relationship works is very important for understanding how z-index will affect the elements. If element A has children, but element B sits on top of it, then no child element A can ever be higher than element B. No matter how high we make the z-index setting. \n\n\t- You can animate z-index, but it is either behind or in front of an element. It will not transition from one to the other. \n\n\tAn example that can be dropped into an online editor like https://codepen.io/pen/ :\n\n\n\t\tCSS\n\t\t\tdiv {\n\t\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\t\tbackground: black;\n\t\t\tcolor: white;\n\t\t\twidth: 100%;\n\t\t\ttop: 35%;\n\t\t\ttext-align: center;\n\t\t\tpadding: 1em\n\t\t}\n\n\t\timg {\n\t\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\t\tleft: 25%;\n\t\t\ttop: 0;\n\t\t\tz-index: -1;\n\t\t\tmargin: 0 auto;\n\t\t}\n\n\n\t\tHTML\n\t\t    <div><h1>Toggle the image\'s z-index property to watch it go backwards and forwards.</h1>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random" width="50%">\n',

            "Content Security Policy (CSP) is an HTTP header that allows site operators fine-grained control over where resources on their site can be loaded from. The use of this header is the best method to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Due to the difficulty in retrofitting CSP into existing websites, CSP is mandatory for all new websites and is strongly recommended for all existing high-risk sites.\n\nThe primary benefit of CSP comes from disabling the use of unsafe inline JavaScript. Inline JavaScript – either reflected or stored – means that improperly escaped user-inputs can generate code that is interpreted by the web browser as JavaScript. By using CSP to disable inline JavaScript, you can effectively eliminate almost all XSS attacks against your site.",

Some interviewers will press this and, possible, be somewhat abrasive and aggressive here. The idea is that they want to see if we know what makes us special, what makes us valuable and why we are a definite good investment. We need to articulate how strengths and be prepared for a reply that challenges this, perhaps like "Everyone does that...", or similar. This part of the interview is not really about our abilities with specific technologies, but more about how we make people around us better, how we have a strong positive impact on teams and how we will not just write the code that is needed, but use our passion, soft skills, and any other personal and professional traits to move projects and teams forward. This needs to be personal and positive.\n\n\n\tSome thoughts to guide this answer:\n\n\tWe are unique; make it obvious.\n\tWe have experience successfully working with others; make it known.\n\tWe have a desire for growth; show why that matters.\n\tWe have natural & leaned skills; relate them to the job and the team.\n\tWe have tremendous ability; showcase it.\n\tWe have passion; make it felt.\n\tWe make a positive impact.\n\tWe are an solid investment.',

            'From Wikipedia.org:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing\n\nA/B testing (also known as bucket testing or split-run testing) is a user experience research methodology. [1] A/B tests consist of a randomized experiment with two variants, A and B.[2][3] It includes application of statistical hypothesis testing or "two-sample hypothesis testing" as used in the field of statistics. A/B testing is a way to compare two versions of a single variable, typically by testing a subject\'s response to variant A against variant B, and determining which of the two variants is more effective.[4] \n\n\nHere is a nice excerpt from this article:\nhttps://crossbrowsertesting.com/blog/visual-testing/ab-testing-screenshots/\n\n"One of the more common testing practices that marketers experiment with is A/B testing, which lets you test two scenarios at once to determine which your audience responds to better. This is done by having control and variable scenarios, which are randomly displayed to users when they visit your site.\n\nThese changes can be as small as testing the color of a CTA button to seeing whether adding a video on a landing page will increase registrations. For example, one user may see a green “Sign Up Now” button, while the other sees a red one. During an A/B test, you may look to see which one gets more clicks in order to inform which color you want to set the button to."\n\nA/B testing tools from a list complied in:\nhttps://www.ventureharbour.com/best-a-b-testing-tools/\n\nGoogle Analytics & Google Optimize - Free\nOptimizely\nVWO\nZoho PageSense\nHubSpot\nLeadformly\nUnbounce\nConvertize\nKameleoon\nConvert\n',

          answer:
            'A very complete answer from:\nhttps://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-create-a-multicolor-text-in-html-and-css.html\n\nYou can create a multicolor text with the help of image editors such as Pixelmator, Photoshop and so on. So, you can create a multicolor image and embed it into your website.\nThe multicolor text will not be searchable with this method.\n\nAs a result, your code will look like the following:\n\n<img src="multicolortext.png"/>\n\nMake separate elements¶\n\nAnother way is creating a text with separate elements by using the HTML <span> tag, which is an empty container. This means that you create a multicolor text by putting each letter in a separate element to define a different color for each letter of your text.\nExample of creating a multicolor text with separate elements in HTML:¶\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Title of the document</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <span style="color:#FF0000">H</span>\n    <span style="color:#66CC66">e</span>\n    <span style="color:#FF9966">l</span>\n    <span style="color:#FFCCCC">l</span>\n    <span style="color:#FF0066">o</span>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\nTry it Yourself »\nResult¶\nUse CSS¶\n\nAnd finally, you can use CSS. This is the easiest way of creating such kind of text.\n\nPut your text in a <span> tag and give it a class name "multicolortext". Then, you need the CSS background-image property to add a gradient background to your text with its "linear-gradient" value, where you put the names of your preferred colors.\n\nTo get multicolor text instead of the multicolor background, you need to use the background-clip property, which lets you control how far a background image or color extends beyond the element\'s padding or content. This step gives some colors to your text, but not exactly what you want.\n\nYou can get the final result by making your text color transparent with the color property so that the background color will be reflected in the text.\nExample of creating a multicolor text with HTML and CSS:¶\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>The title of the document</title>\n    <style>\n      .multicolortext {\n        background-image: linear-gradient(to left, violet, indigo, green, blue, yellow, orange, red);\n        -webkit-background-clip: text;\n        -moz-background-clip: text;\n        background-clip: text;\n        color: transparent;\n      }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>\n      <span class="multicolortext">Let’s be creative!</span>\n    </h1>\n  </body>\n</html>',

            "This question is designed to make sure we want to grow and that we have thought about our current direction and future goals...and that those short-term goals mesh with company interests.\n\nA few thoughts on crafting some talking points for this answer:\n\n- Start with a a plan for this year. This is an opportunity to drive home areas where the companies and our interests mesh nicely. In addition, knowing how we want to be better just one year from now can show a commitment to constant growth.\n- Give a brief outline of what your ideal professional self would be five years from now. Make it real and doable, but still a bit of a long reach. Unrealistic goals or extremely small goals are not going to help us look any better. High, but achievable, goals can be inspiring.\n- The five-year goals can include:\n\t\t- A higher understanding of certain principles.\n\t\t- More experience and deeper knowledge in one or two technologies (ideally ones that are associated with the job being considered).\n\t\t- A general increased role and professional status, like becoming a senior dev, leading a team or even entering into management.\n\t\t- One or two new languages, tools or processes that would build on the current ones (ideally meshing with what the company offers, if possible).\n\t\t- Certain experience within a team or some similar goal that relates to being even better working with others.\n\t\t- Conferences, talks, meetups, projects related to career path, etc.\n- Give a brief outline of what your ideal personal self would be five years from now. This can be anything at all and should definitely be genuine. Family life, personal project (writing a book, starting a group, etc), growing hobbies or adding new ones, physical fitness, etc.",

There are a number of methods including play() and pause() as well as load().\n\n- Text Track API: Picking up where the Media API leaves off, the Text Track API allows us to interact with text tracks (subtitles or captions) for the audio and videos.\n\n- Drag and Drop: There are a number of possibilities with this API. Among these, you can add  'draggable' attribute to allow a user to move an element then have event handlers in place on a drop zone so the browser knows where the element can be dropped.\n\n- History API: This spec gives developers more control of the user's browser session. Along with moving the the user forward or backward, we can check the length of the history and even add or remove entries. We can hold data enabling us to restore a page or just update the URL without refreshing the page.\n",

The goal for an answer to any question about accessibility is to show that we have a basic understanding combined with being able to about real-world use.\n\nAccessibility is no longer just something nice to incorporate, it is essential for making sure people, best practices and, in some cases, laws are being respected. \n\nA few accessibility features we can incorporate:\n\nThoughtful contrasting colors for people who have trouble seeing color. This allows them to see a difference between two colored areas.\n\nAria labels are important for signalling correct detail to screen readers.\n\nUsing tags instead of CSS properties, like <em> instead of font-weight, will signal to screen-readers the intent to emphasis. This can then be past along to the user.\nThere are tools available, like Lighthouse now included in Chrome Dev Tools, that can run scans and alert us to accessibility concerns.\n\n\nHere is an example of the <em> and an aria label:\n\n\n    <p>Hi my name is Sheev Palpatine, but you can call me <em>EMPORER DARTH SIDIOUS</em></p>\n\n    <button aria-label="Close Modal">Close</button>',

It is important to separate concerns for multi-faceted projects like web pages.\n\n\t<h1 style="color: blue;">Example</h1>\n\n- <style> tags in the documents <head> can be used to assign selectors to declarations. The browser will then link classes used on the elements in the <body> to the selectors in the <style> tag.

The browser will then using the selctors in the external style sheet to link to classes on the page elements and apply the associated declarations.\n\n\tThe most versatile, clear and maintainable because it enables a sheet, or sheets, with only CSS-related material. We can group selectors as we see fit and even separate them into separate sheets when the need arises.

This can sometimes be concerning for a company as they might think that makes us a short-term investment or, much worse, a bad investment due to some inability to get along with people or perform.\nThis question is our opportunity to remove these doubts. A simple explanation can go a long way, even if there was a bad situation and we can speak to how we learned from it.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with wanting to make more money or move up in role or even just find a culture that meshes better with our values, work ethic and/or future goals. We just need to give a brief reasoning that includes our thoughts surrounding big moves, our steps to work with our current employer before making th e moves and how those decisions ended up being good or, perhaps, lessons that we learned from those that did not.\n\nUltimately, we don't want to lie or give the impression we are trying to cover anything up. There are always reasons and many of them are good reasons. Taking advantage of opportunities for personal or professional advancement are definitely good reasons. On the other side, some reasons are lessons that are part of our growth.\n",

          answer:
            "This question is designed to see our thought process on this issue.\n\nHere are some basic steps for approaching a slow app:\n\n\t1. Define the specific problem. What, specifically is slow? Is the initial load slow? Are page transitions slow? Do the interactions, like menu animations, seem slow or choppy? Does this occur on only some browsers or devices? \n\n\t\tUltimately, the goal here is to get as clear a picture as possible as of each part that is slow. This enables us to find the best spots to begin drilling down.\n\n\t2. Narrow the scope: Next we want to take our drill-down points and begin to narrow each of those to as small a piece of code as we can. \n\n\t\tFor instance, if the issue is slow loading, a good place to start is either Chrome Dev Tools' Lighthouse tool or a page speed analyzer. One popular one is: \n\n\t\thttps://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/\n\n\t\tThese tools can help see where it is slow, like the first paint or how long until a user can actually interact with the page. From there it can help us pinpoint potential problem areas, like large images or slow server response.\n\n\t\tin a browser's dev tools we can use other tools, like the Network section to see detail on specific items like when they loaded, how long they took and if they were blocking progress. \n\n\t\tIf the issue is something not related to resources loading, dev tools can help narrow down the search using the Debugger, Performance, Inspector, Console and others. \n\n\t3. Isolate: Once we gained an understanding of the specific symptoms and then narrowed the scope of our attention, we can now address these specific areas of code. Dev tools Debugger can be great for stepping through JavaScript. The Performance tool can help see how an animation affects the page processing. \n\n\t\tIf need be, it can help to isolate specific blocks of code in a separate editor, perhaps even an online editor like repl.it, codepen.io or jsbin.com. This can help zero-in on specific problems in the code.\n\t\tAlong the same line of thinking, commenting out blocks of code and/or temporarily inserting new simplified code can help ensure we have properly identified the problem area.\n\n\t4. Fix: By this point, we have arrived at the problem pieces of code. Now, we just need to correct the issue.\n\n\t5. Test...a lot: We have not fixed the problem at this point. We have only written the code that we think will correct the issue. Test. Test. Test then take a break...test again. At that point, we have fixed teh issue.",

            'There are a wide array of strategies for this answer. Below are a few basic approaches, though a web search (click the "More About this Question" button for that) will yield a wealth of detail and other options.\n\n- We can just give an amount we would like to make and we think we are worth. it is simple and direct, though it might be a factor in eliminating us from the candidate list if the number far exceeds what the company wants to spend on the position or thinks we are worth. This approach is not concerned with staying in market value. It is more about weeding out companies that can not or do not wish to pay what we value our services at. \n\n- We can take our current salary and just raise that a little. Assuming we are applying for a similar position, or even slightly elevated, this keeps us around market range. \n\n- If the job is meant to be an entry into a new career, pushing for more money might hurt the greater purpose. We might want to consider looking for the salary range listed in the job post and speaking to an amount towards the middle, with a minimum around the listed minimum. Or, perhaps, if our situation is one where little more or less would not matter and getting in the door is the focus, being honest about this can be OK. It would be best to also ask how soon someone is eligible for a raise and to make sure they do not offer below their posted minimum. There are some who would say never ask for or imply the offered minimum, but getting the first foot in can make a tremendous difference and then enable us to make the next interview about what we are really worth.\n\n- Use online tools to find a market salary range and then ask for a salary somewhere between the average and the top salary depending on where our skills and experience put us.\n\n\n\tA few tools for finding market value:\n\n\t\tGlassDoor: https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/index.htm\n\t\tPayScale: https://www.payscale.com/my/survey/choose\n\t\tLinkedin Salary Tool: https://www.linkedin.com/salary/',

          answer:
            'This answer comes from:\nhttps://resource-centre.net/html5-tutorials/bullet-point-lists/\n\nBullet Point Lists (or Unordered Lists)\n\nThe first kind of list we will look at is using bullets.\nUnordered List – the <ul> Tag\n\nBullet point lists are also known as unordered lists (UL) because there is no numbering involved. That is why a bulleted list uses the <ul> </ul> tag pair. Here is a basic example:\n\nThe whole list is surrounded by <ul> </ul> for a start. When you open your list tag, make sure you automatically type your closing tag and then proceed to fill your items between them.\nThe type Attribute\n\nThe type attribute determines what kind of bullet you are seeing on the page. Although through CSS you can specify a wide-range of bullet styles, and even use your own image, in raw HTML it is best to stick with the common types which are\n\n    type="circle" – an unfilled circle\n\n    type="disc" – a filled circle\n\n    type="square" – a filled square\n\nList Items – the <li> Tag\n\nEach individual item in your list is wrapped in its own <li> </li> tag pair. You can often get away without the </li> but I would recommend keeping it in, just so you maintain healthy coding habit.\n\nThe list above I placed in individual <ul> but each <li> also supports the type attribute, such that I could create\n\n    Square\n    Disc\n    Circle\n\nNot sure why you would want to do that, but you can if you want to!\n\nBullet List Indentation\n\nBefore you apply any CSS to your list, HTML (or more accurately, your browser) will apply indentation to your list, so it stands out from your normal paragraph <p> tags.\nOrdered / Numbered Lists – the <ol> Tag\n\nIf you want to present your list in an ordered fashion, then the <ol> tag is your friend. By default this will give you a numbered list, but the type attribute gives you flexibility, in the same way as bullet point lists do.\n\nwhich outputs\n\n    Item 1\n    Item 2\n    Item 3\n\nThe type attribute offers a few more options in ordered lists compared to bulleted ones. A bit more guidance on this can be obtained at W3Schools.\nStarting an Ordered List On A Different Number\n\nSay you were putting together some instructions to build a table. You may want to use a numbered list to achieve this. However, if you wanted to put images and extra text between each stage, you would probably need multiple lists. The problem is that each list starts at number 1 (or letter A) by default. That would screw up your instructions!\n\nThankfully HTML has the start property to allow you to start on a subsequent number:\n\nThis outputs:\n\n    Step Four\n    Step Five\n    Step Six\n\nReversing The Order\n\nIf you want to show your numbers (or letters) in reverse order, then this is really easy too. You might want to do a ‘Top 10’ with your best item announced last, for example. This can be done by adding the word reversed into your Ordered List opening tag:\n\nAnd this would make your list look like this:\n\n    First LI\n    Second LI\n    Third LI\n    Fourth LI\n    Fifth LI\n\nMulti-Level Bullet List in HTML\n\nWith patchy browser support (and sometimes undone by CSS in some sites) you can create a multilevel list. This is achieved by embedding one list inside another:\n\nWhich creates:\n\n    Top Level Item\n        Sub-Item 1\n        Sub-Item 2\n    Top Level Item\n\nYou can use a combination of <ul> and <ol>. That may be useful if you want bullet points under a numbered list.\n\n    Top Level Item\n        Sub-Item 1\n        Sub-Item 2\n    Top Level Item\n',

In either case, we need to work into the interview an example or two that showcases our ability to work with others. Overall, we want to exhibit good communication skills, and a brief bit about how important we think communication skills are when working with teams, or our superiors, the client, etc can help. Perhaps even a story about a time when kept our calm when others did not, or an example of how we set aside things that bothered us, and were able to generate harmony that helped move a project forward. All of this needs to be delivered, like all of our answers, with good eye contact without staring, enthusiasm married with a calm and thoughtful approach and general good will and respectful manner. These qualities can mean a lot to a company and can raise our profile above others in the eyes of the interviewer.\n",

          answer:
            'The following excerpt come from bitofco.de:\nhttps://bitsofco.de/understanding-the-virtual-dom/\n\nWhy do we need a virtual DOM?\n\nTo understand why the concept of the virtual DOM arose, let’s revisit the original DOM. As I mentioned, there are two parts to the DOM - the object-based representation of the HTML document and the API to manipulating that object.\n\nFor example, let’s take this simple HTML document with an unordered list and one list item.\n\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang="en">\n <head></head>\n <body>\n    <ul class="list">\n        <li class="list__item">List item</li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\n\nThis document can be represented as the following DOM tree:\n\nhtml\nhead lang="en"\nbody\nul class="list"\nli class="list__item"\n"List item"\n\nLet’s say we want to modify the content of the first list item to \n"List item one"\n and also add a second list item. To do this, we will need use the DOM APIs to find the elements we want to update, create the new elements, add attributes and content, then finally update the DOM elements themselves.\n\nconst listItemOne = document.getElementsByClassName("list__item")[0];\nlistItemOne.textContent = "List item one";\n\nconst list = document.getElementsByClassName("list")[0];\nconst listItemTwo = document.createElement("li");\nlistItemTwo.classList.add("list__item");\nlistItemTwo.textContent = "List item two";\nlist.appendChild(listItemTwo);\n\nThe DOM wasn’t made for this…\n\nWhen the first specification for the DOM was released in 1998, we built and managed web pages in very differently. There was far less reliance on the DOM APIs to create and update the page content as frequently as we do today.\n\nSimple methods such as \ndocument.getElementsByClassName()\n are fine to use on a small scale, but if we are updating multiple elements on a page every few seconds, it can start to become really expensive to constantly query and update the DOM.\n\nEven further, because of the way the APIs are setup, it is usually simpler to perform more expensive operations where we update larger parts of the document than to find and update the specific elements. Going back to our list example, it is in some ways easier to replace the entire unordered list with a new one than to modify the specific elements.\n\nconst list = document.getElementsByClassName("list")[0];\nlist.innerHTML = `\n<li class="list__item">List item one</li>\n<li class="list__item">List item two</li>\n`;\n\n\nIn this particular example, the performance difference between the methods is probably insignificant. However, as the size of the web page grows, it becomes more important to only select and update what is needed.\n\n… but the virtual DOM was!\n\nThe virtual DOM was created to solve these problems of needing to frequently update the DOM in a more performant way. Unlike the DOM or the shadow DOM, the virtual DOM isn\'t an official specification, but rather a new method of interfacing with the DOM.\n\nA virtual DOM can be thought of as a copy of the original DOM. This copy can be frequently manipulated and updated, without using the DOM APIs. Once all the updates have been made to the virtual DOM, we can look at what specific changes need to be made to the original DOM and make them in a targetted and optimised way.',

We just need to demonstrate an understanding of the core concepts.\n\nThere have been the addition of web components native to the browser. modern frameworks have already had components built in for a while.\n\nA component will usually have an HTML template that we can pass in properties or other data. This allows us to build a component once and then use it multiple times. \n\nCommon uses are a navigation menu or model or buttons.

In some cases, authentication can be part of this connection. This might be a JSON web token, or some other data, included in the request.\n- The server will then send the requested data to the browser.\n- The browser will then render the page to the screen. \n\n- The new web page might include dependencies, like CSS ot JavaScript sheets, or images, etc. The browser will then either request these via the same connection, or, if the begin the process for a new connection to retrieve each item.\n\n- Once the browser page (tab or window) is closed, the connection to the server ends.\n\n",

That is not realistic and it leaves the question wide open as to what they can expect from us if we encounter conflict while working there. Even a story about how we handled conflict poorly is fine, as long as we can talk clearly about how we thought and felt at the time and how we eventually learned how to handle it all better. \n\nTo put it simply:\n\tBe human. \n\tShow growth. \n\tShow thought. \n\tShow intent to understand others, even if they are acting poorly. \n\tShow a desire to explore the finer points of human interaction.\n\tShow that all of the above maters enough to have carefully thought about it.\n",

W3C\'s standards define key parts of what makes the World Wide Web work. Learn more about W3C\'s mission.\nWhere is W3C located?\n\nW3C does not have a single physical headquarters. There are four institutions, however, that "host" W3C: MIT (in Cambridge, MA, USA), ERCIM (in Sophia-Antipolis, France), Keio University (near Tokyo, Japan), and Beihang University (in Beijing, China).\n\nThe W3C staff is distributed around the world, but there are concentrations of people in Cambridge, Massachusetts (USA), Sophia-Antipolis (France), and Tokyo (Japan). In addition, W3C is represented in 17 other regions of the world via representatives based at organizations. W3C calls these regional points of contact "W3C Offices."\nHow is W3C funded?\n\nW3C receives funds from:\n\n    W3C Member dues\n    Research grants and other sources of private and public funding\n    Individual donations of money and equipment \n\nWhat is the difference between the Web and the Internet?\n\nFrom the definition in the Wikipedia: "The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that interchange data by packet switching using the standardized Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)."\n\nThus, the Internet is a network of networks, defined by the TPC/IP standards.\n\nThe Web, on the other hand, is defined in W3C\'s Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume I as follows: "The World Wide Web (WWW, or simply Web) is an information space in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI)."\n\nThus, the Web is an information space.

            "What is async, defer, preload and prefetch for loading JavaScript documents",
          answer:
            'All of this addresses the loading of documents and how they affect the main document.\n\nFrom:https://javascript.info/script-async-defer\n\n\nDEFER:\n\nThe defer attribute tells the browser not to wait for \nthe script. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, \nbuild DOM. The script loads “in the background”, and then runs when the \nDOM is fully built.\n\nHere’s the same example with defer:\n<p>...content before script...</p>\n\n<scrip/t defer src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js?speed=1"></scrip/t>\n\n<!-- visible immediately -->\n<p>...content after script...</p>\n\n\nIn other words:\n\n    - Scripts with defer never block the page.\n    - Scripts with defer always execute when the DOM is ready (but before DOMContentLoaded event).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASYNC\n\nThe async attribute is somewhat like \ndefer. It also makes the script non-blocking. But it has important differences in the behavior.\n\nThe async attribute means that a script is completely independent:\n\n    - The browser doesn’t block on async scripts (like defer).\n    - Other scripts don’t wait for async scripts, and async scripts don’t wait for them.\n    - DOMContentLoaded and async scripts don’t wait for each other:\n        | DOMContentLoaded may happen both before an async script (if an async script finishes loading after the page is complete)\n        | …or after an async script (if an async script is short or was in HTTP-cache)\n\n    <p>...content before scripts...</p>\n\n    <scrip/t>\n      document.addEventListener(\'DOMContentLoaded\', () => alert("DOM ready!"));\n    </scrip/t>\n\n    <scrip/t async src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js"></scrip/t>\n    <scrip/t async src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/small.js"></scrip/t>\n\n    <p>...content after scripts...</p>\n\n\n\nThe following examples come from: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/html-preload-prefetch\n\n\n    \nPRELOAD\n\nPreloading JavaScript resources is done differently. This example, taken from this Google Developers article on preloading, shows this:\nindex.html\n\n<link rel="preload" href="used-later.js" as="scrip/t">\n<!-- ... -->\n<scrip/t>\n  var usedLaterScript = document.createElement(\'script\');\n  usedLaterScript.src = \'used-later.js\';\n  document.body.appendChild(usedLaterScript);\n</scrip/t>\n\n\n\nPREFETCH\n\nPrefetching works similarly to preloading. The difference is that, \nwhen prefetching a resource, the browser considers the resource to be \nlow priority. This means that the resource or asset will load a bit \nlater. Because of this, prefetching is usually implemented with \nresources that are not required initially, but are used at a later \npoint.\n\nTo implement prefectching in your HTML page, change the value of \nrel to "prefetching.\n\nindex.html\n<link\n  rel="prefetch"\n  as="style"\n  onload="this.rel = \'stylesheet\'"\n  href=\'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:100,900|Material+Icons\'>\n',

          answer:
            'This is generally asked to get an idea of how much someone pays attention to good practices and, ultimately, will write easier to understand code and have an easier time jumping into someone else\'s code.\n\nGeneral naming conventions:\n-\tNames should be brief, but descriptive enough that the average non-developer could understand. For example, using "d = new Date()" might serve brevity, but can make no sense later in the program and require extra effort to understand. Conversely, "theDateForTheDayTheAppIsRun = new Date()" is clear, but unnecessarily long. Simply "todaysDate = new Date()" is brief and easily understood.\n\nA few JavaScript examples can be:\n- Camel case for variables: const lastName = \'Kenobi\'\n- Pascal case for classes: class MainCharacter { }\n- "is" or "has" prefix for booleans.\n- Function calls that will be returning something can start with have a descriptive verb ("update", "get", etc).\n- As few variables as possible. This is not really a naming convention, but it greatly affects the abilty for the names of the variables that do get used to be easier to follow and keep track of.\n- Do not re-use variable names.\n- In many cases it is better not to make a variable equal itself with modification. This can be difficult to follow through and can often be better served with a new, variable descriptively named to match the newly formed data.\n- When reasonable, if a specific item in an array is being used, assign a more descriptive variable: const updatedFileId = changes[0]\n- Property names that do not need to be prefixed with the class name. \n\tWe do not need: class Car {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructor(brand, purchaseDate) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.carName = brand;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.carYear = purchaseDate;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n} \n\tInstead, we can use: class Car {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructor(brand) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.name = brand;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.year = purchaseDate;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t} \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t// in use it will still be descriptive\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconst myCar = new Car();\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmyCar,name = \'Jeep\';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmyCar.year = \'2017\';\n- Avoid "magic" numbers, or numbers without a name, when possible. \n\tWe want to avoid: const forwardMovement = duration * 3;\n\tWe can use: const rate = 3;\n\t\t\t\t  forwardMovement = duration * rate;\n\t\t\t\t \n\nCSS & HTML examples:\n- Use nicely cascading rules to make for as few selectors as possible.\n- Kabab case for selectors: .inner-wrap\n- Descriptive selector names. This can be the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) method or similar.\n- Try to avoid using the same name for an ID and a class. These are technically independent from each other, but this can cause confusion for a developer.\n',

            'The rest parameter syntax allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array, providing a way to represent variadic functions in JavaScript. This is often not ideal, as we are generally better off knowing how many parameters we will be passing, but for the occasions where we do not, the Rest operator makes for a clean, readable and powerful tool.\n\n\nfunction sum(...theArgs) {\n  let total = 0;\n  for (const arg of theArgs) {\n    total += arg;\n  }\n  return total;\n}\n\nconsole.log(sum(1, 2, 3));\n// Expected output: 6\n\nconsole.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4));\n// Expected output: 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spread (...) syntax allows an iterable, such as an array or string, to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected. In an object literal, the spread syntax enumerates the properties of an object and adds the key-value pairs to the object being created.\n\nSpread syntax looks exactly like rest syntax. In a way, spread syntax is the opposite of rest syntax. Spread syntax "expands" an array into its elements, while rest syntax collects multiple elements and "condenses" them into a single element. See rest parameters and rest property.\n\nfunction sum(x, y, z) {\n\n  return x + y + z;\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3];\n\n\n\n\nconsole.log(sum(...numbers));\n\n// Expected output: 6\n\n\n\n\nconsole.log(sum.apply(null, numbers));\n\n// Expected output: 6\n\n\n',

            'This might sound like a silly question, but questions like this sometimes are used to get us to show our understanding of basic, but often needed, aspects of CSS. This will usually be a screening question, so a descriptive verbal outline will needed, not actual code.\n\nTo begin, we need to target our element via ID, or by class for multiple elements. We then want to set an equal width and height, perhaps 100px each. From there, we can either set the border for a few pixels or a background color or even both. This way we can see it. At that point, we have a square.\n\nMaking that square a circle simply requires a border-radius of 50% all of the way around. \n\nNow, that is a fixed width square or circle. We could make it responsive by using a percentage as the width and an equal percentage as padding-bottom. If there is content in the square or circle, one way to keep the sides equal would be to absolutely position the content. Ultimately, this is just an option. There are many ways to approach graphics in CSS, and purpose and the rest of the document will play into a plan for making the graphics responsive.\n\n\nPaste this example into an online editor, like https://codepen.io/pen/, to see the square and circle:\n\n\tCSS\n\t\t.square {\n\t\t\tbackground: lightgreen;\n\t\t\twidth: 50%;\n\t\t\tpadding-bottom: 50%;\n\t\t\tmargin: 0 auto;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t.square.circle {\n\t\t\tborder-radius: 50%;\n\t\t\tbackground: salmon;\n\t\t}\n\n\tHTML\n\t\t<div class="square"></div>\n\n\t\t<div class="square circle"></div>',

            "The days of great consideration being paid to Internet Explorer's many differences will, or possibly have, come to an end. This does not mean browser compatibility is no longer a concern. \nModern browsers are much more consistent with including features, but it is still good to check with a tool like https://caniuse.com/ or MDN to make sure new features are well covered.\n\nFor most browsers, we can easily download them and test our app. But what about older versions of each browser? What about these browsers on different devices. What if we need to test on Safari, but do not have access to a Mac? There are tools like https://www.browserstack.com/ to test web apps in many different ways. Some will even monitor real users on different browsers and devices. We can even have automated routines to test these scenarios.  \n\nBeyond testing, it is important that we know well what our target audience is going to be. If it is truly a global reach we are seeking, we need to consider things like Opera Mini (popular in parts of the world with slow internet), Baidu (a popular China-based browser), KaiOS' browser (mobile OS and browser used all over and especially in India) and any others that are used.\n\nAll of this does not mean that wide-reach intentions mean we need to remove most of our JavaScript just to make the app work right on Opera Mini. It just means just that we need to consider what happens to our product for the those users and work towards good solutions. \n\nWhithin any app, we should pay attention to current browser compatibility and utilize thinking along these lines:\n\n\t- We might just need to ensure there are fullbacks in place.\n\n\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\tposition: sticky; // Not fully supported by some browsers\n\n\t- We can plan our interactions and layouts so that nothing critical relies on technology not fully supported.\t\n\n\t- We can check for specific feature support in a browser and have separate functionality ready. This is not ideal as it requires extra consideration when maintaining the web app, but it is a workable solution.\n\n\t- We and the customer can consider the costs vs the gains related to supporting certain browsers. The benefits might not offset the costs of supporting a specific browser's use and/or the areas of the world it is popular.",

It can be used also to dynamically build selectors, but that feature is deprecated and replaced by different more powerful option.\n\nSyntax\n\nUse either ~"whatever" or ~\'whatever\' syntax to escape property values. Anything between quotes is used as is with almost no changes. The "as is" rule has one exception: string interpolation works with the usual @{variableName} syntax.\n\nUsed as Property Value\n\nSample input:\n\n@variable: "dynamic";\nh1 {\n  margin: 1 ~"2 2" 3;\n  padding: ~\'ms:special.syntax()\';\n  text: ~\'@{variable}\'; //interpolation works\n}\n\ncompiles into:\n\nh1 {\n  margin: 1 2 2 3;\n  padding: ms:special.syntax();\n  text: dynamic;\n}\n\n',

            "Excerpts from hacker.io:\n\nCSS was originally released in 1996 and consists of properties for adding font properties such as typeface and emphasis color of text, backgrounds, and other elements. CSS2 was released in 1998 with added styles for other media types so that it can be used for page layout designing. CSS3 was released in 1999 and presentation-style properties were added in it that allows you to build a presentation from documents.\n\nUnlike CSS2, which was comprised of a single document, CSS3 has its specifications divided into many individual modules, which makes CSS3 a whole lot easier to handle.\n\nWith CSS3, the designers can now use special fonts, like those available in Google Fonts and Typecast. Earlier, with CSS and CSS2, designers could only use “web-safe fonts” for being 100% sure to use fonts that would always display the same on every machine.\n\nWhile CSS and CSS2 had ‘simple selectors’, CSS3 calls the components as ‘a sequence of simple selectors’.\n\nCSS3 came up with some key web design considerations like rounded borders that help in rounding up the borders without any hassle. This turned out to be a huge plus point for developers who were struggling with initial versions of CSS borders.\n\nCSS3 has the capability to split text sections into multiple columns so that it can be read like a newspaper. In CSS2, the developers had difficulty because the standard was not equipped with automatically breaking the text so that it fits within a box.\n\n",

          answer:
            'Synchronous code runs from top to bottom in order. One line, command, function, etc is processed and resolved before moving to the next. This can be problematic if you encounter "blocking" code, which is code that causes processing one item for a longer amount of time. This means the rest of the program (and end user) wait until the program can mover on to the next line. This is where asynchronous code can be helpful.\n\nAsynchronous code runs separately from other code. This means it can take longer to process without "blocking" the rest of the program from running. In JavaScript, the Call Stack processes code synchronously. If a piece of asynchronous code is encountered, it is moved out of the Call Stack. If it is part of a Web API, like setTimeOut(), then the browser handles the resolving the code. Otherwise, it is moved to the Callback Que. In either case, the Event Loop will take the next item that has resolved, and place it on the Call Stack. This time, when the code can be dealt with in order because it is ready and will not block the processing the rest of the program.',

Vertical gives a feeling of balance, formality and alertness. Oblique suggests movement and action    \n\n\nSIZE – Size is simply the relationship of the area occupied by one shape to that of another.    \n\n\nTEXTURE – Texture is the surface quality of a shape – rough, smooth, soft hard glossy etc.    \n\n\nCOLOR – Color is light reflected off objects. Color has three main characteristics: hue or its name (red, green, blue, etc.), value (how light or dark it is), and intensity (how bright or dull it is).",

The answer says more about the applicant’s personality than programming skills.\n\nWhat to look for in an answer:\n\n    Understanding of CSS's benefits\n    Creative problem solving\n    How applicant responds to challenges\n\nExample:\n“I helped a friend build an online magazine that published articles, photographs, music and all kinds of media. It wasn’t a hard project. In fact, it was pretty easy. I just loved watching how happy my simple CSS changes made him. Over a few hours, his website went from OK to excellent. It reminded me of why it’s important to know CSS, JavaScript and other common languages in today’s world. You can’t do anything without building a good website to show it off.” ",

          level: "basic",
          answer:
            "Closure is an inner function, that is accessible outside of its parent function's scope while maintaining its connection to the parent's variables and other data. This can be don to keep some data private and purposely expose other data.\nTo accomplish this, an anonymous function can be immediately invoked. In this function, data we wish to keep  private can be processed. Usually this data would be removed from memory via JavaScript's \"garbage collection\" memory clearing process. If this function returns a function, let's call it a child function, that accesses data from the parent function, the parent's data will remain in memory. In this situation, the only access to the parent function's data will be via whatever had been set up in the child function. In addition, every time the child function is invoked, a new function scope is created for the child function. The parent function scope is only created once. This means that we can invoke the child function to change a variable in the parent and the next time we invoke the child function the variable in the parent will still reflect the change. \n\nThis can be considered state management and might not be as useful today given other options to manage state. Still, this process can be used to protect sensitive data or even just a to keep a counter variable from being accidentally increased.\n\nSome examples\n// For comparison, this is a counter without closure\nlet counter = 0;\n\nfunction add1 () {\n\tcounter++;\n\treturn counter;\n}\n\nconsole.log(add1());  // 1\nconsole.log(add1());  // 2\n// The counter becomes unpredictable when it can be altered elswhere\ncounter++;\nconsole.log(add1());  // 4\n\n\n// This is a counter with closure\nconst add1 = (function () {\n  let counter = 0;\n\n  return function () {\n\tcounter++;\n\treturn counter;\n  };\n})();\nconsole.log(add1());  // 1\nconsole.log(add1());  // 2\nconsole.log(add1());  // 3\ncounter++;// error: counter is not defined\nconsole.log(add1());\n\n// Another, more complex example\n// In this travelAgent() in the child function made available, while \n// the \"trip\" variable and agent() function are accessible through \n// travelAgent(). The book() function, is only accessible through agent().\nfunction vacation() {\n\tvar trip;\n\n\tfunction travelAgent(itinerary) {\n\t\tagent(itinerary);\n\t\treturn trip;\n\t}\n\n\tfunction agent(itinerary) {\n\t\tif (itinerary === 'Orlando') {\n\t\t\ttrip = ['Orlando', 'Disney', 'Universal'];\n\t\t\tbook();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tfunction book() {\n\t\ttrip.push('booked');\n\t}\n\treturn travelAgent;\n}\n\nvar myVacation = vacation();\n\nconsole.log(myVacation('Orlando'));\n\n// Array [ \"Orlando\", \"Disney\", \"Universal\", \"booked\" ]\n",

A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.\n\nO - Open-closed principle. Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.\n\nL - Liskov substitution principle. Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.\n\nI - Interface segregation principle. A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.\n\nD - Dependency Inversion Principle. Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.\n\nHere is a good article on the subject: https://dev.to/francescoxx/solid-principles-in-javascript-3pek\n",

            "Advantages\n\n    Sass facilitates you to write clean, easy and less CSS in a programming construct.\n    It contains fewer codes so you can write CSS quicker.\n    It is more stable, powerful, and elegant because it is an extension of CSS. So, it is easy for designers and developers to work more efficiently and quickly.\n    It is compatible with all versions of CSS. So, you can use any available CSS libraries.\n    It provides nesting so you can use nested syntax and useful functions like color manipulation, math functions and other values.\n\nDisadvantages\n\n    The developer must have enough time to learn new features present in this preprocessor before using it.\n    Using Sass may result in the loss of some benefits of a browser's built-in element inspector.",

            "This addresses what happens when passing data from one variable to another. More specifically, this is about where variables point. \n\nThe original variable points to a place in memory. The new variable can either point to the same place in memory, which means the reference to the data was passed, or the new variable can point to a new place in memory that contains the same data, which means the values were passed to the new memory location.\n\nThe main reason this is important is shown by the results of changing either variable. If only a reference was passed, meaning both variables point to the same data at the same memory location, then changing a value will change change it for both variables, as well as any others pointing to the same place in memory.\n\nIf the actual values were passed and reside at a new location in memory, changing the values at the new memory location will only be visible with the new variable (and any others pointing to that location). The original variable is still pointing at the old memory location and remains unchanged.\n\nExamples:\nlet example1 = 1;\nlet example2 = example1;\nexample2++;\n\nconsole.log(example1, ' - ', example2);\n\nconst example3 = {\n  weapon: 'lightsaber'\n};\nconst example4 = {\n  ...example3\n};\nexample4.name = 'Darth Vader';\nconsole.log(example3, ' - ', example4);",

It is positioned relative to the initial containing block established by the viewport, except when one of its ancestors has a transform, perspective, or filter property set to something other than none (see the CSS Transforms Spec), in which case that ancestor behaves as the containing block. (Note that there are browser inconsistencies with perspective and filter contributing to containing block formation.)

The + character has got you covered:\n\n.button + .button { ... }",

          answer:
            "Here is a video introduction to hooks:\nhttps://youtu.be/dpw9EHDh2bM\n\n\nHooks let you use state and other React features without writing a class.\n\n\nExample of the useState hook:\n\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Example() {\n  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call \"count\"  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\n        Click me\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nA few snippets from https://softwareontheroad.com/react-hooks/\n\n\n When you work with Reactjs class components you can use state, that’s why these components are also called stateful, also every class component has lifecycle methods like: componentDidMount(), componentDidUpdate(), and so on.\n\nYou can’t use any of this in functional components. Functional components can’t use their own state and don’t have lifecycle methods.\n\nNow with React hooks you can.\n\nReact hooks allows us to take a Reactjs functional component and add state and lifecycle methods to it.\n\nIn simple words, React hooks are special functions to extend the capabilities of functional components and give them the possibility to have lifecycle events and manage state.\n\n\nThe existing React hooks 🍱\n\nThe new API comes with two main pre-existing hooks, and some others for other use cases\nBasics React hooks\n\nThe foundation of all React hooks, every other hook you will see is a variation of these three or are using them as primitives.\n\n    useState is the State hook use it for declaring the state in your components\n    useEffect is the Side effects hook use it for data fetching, manually changing the DOM, and etc.\n    useContext use it in conjunction with Reactjs Context API. When the React Context provider updates, this hook will trigger render with the latest context value.\n\nAdvance React hooks\n\nThese are the most important of the other built-in React hooks that come with the library.\n\n    The useReducer is an alternative to useState, you should use it when you have complex state logic, if you’re familiar with Redux you will like it.\n    The useRef use it for accessing a DOM element with a mutable ref object. Is more useful than the ref attribute\n\n\n\nRules\n\n    Never call Hooks from inside a loop, condition or nested function\n    Never call a Hook from a regular function\n    Only call them inside functions components or custom hooks\n    Hooks should sit at the top level of your component\n    Hooks can call other Hooks\n\n\n\n",

            "Comparing to see if two objects are not really just one referencing the other: Object.is(). This will tell us if one is really just a variable that was passed a reference to the original object, like with: const var1 = obj1; This is only a reference, so Object.is(var1, obj1) will equal true. If so, the values will always be identical.\n\nComparing unique objects can be a little more involved. There is a loose approach and a more strict approach. \n\nWe can test the number of entries in each, as a different number of entries would indicate they are different. We can do this by checking if one has more keys than the other using Object.keys().length or Object.getOwnPropertyNames().length.\nWhen iterating through the objects, we must also account for the possibility of nested arrays and/or objects. These might even go many levels deep.\n\nOne way is to turn both objects into strings using JSON.stringify() and then compare the strings. This will ONLY work if we know the keys will always be IN THE SAME ORDER. When using this method, any variance, like a key being in a different place, will cause the comparison to fail even though the values might be identical.\n\nA more strict approach is to iterate through each object and check the key-value pair against the other. This will work even if the keys are not in the same order. \n\n\nconst user1 = {\n  first: 'Lando',\n  last: 'Calrissian'\n};\nconst user2 = {\n  first: 'Lando',\n  last: 'Calrissian'\n};\n\n\n// Direct comparison\nconsole.log(user1 === user2);  // false\n\n// Stringify process\nconst stringObj1 = JSON.stringify(user1);\nconst stringObj2 = JSON.stringify(user2);\n\nconsole.log(typeof stringObj1);  // string\nconsole.log(stringObj1 === stringObj2);  // true\n\n\n\n// Iterating process possibiltiy\nfunction isSameObject (obj1, obj2) {\n  const props1 = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj1);\n  const props2 = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj2);\n\n  if (props1.length !== props2.length) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < props1.length; i++) {\n    const property = props1[i];\n\n    if (props1[property] !== props2[property]) {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return true;\n}\n\nconsole.log(isSameObject(user1, user2));  // true",

Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized, and get small stylesheets up and running quickly.\n\nA CSS preprocessor is a scripting language that extends CSS by allowing developers to write code in one language and then compile it into CSS.",

          answer:
            "A pseudo-element in CSS is similar to a pseudo-class in that it uses a keyword added to a selector, but he similarities end there. CSS pseudo-elements let us style a specific part of elements or even add to the beginning or end of the element. In addition, a pseudo-element will use double colons between the keyword and the selector. Technically, because this double-colon convention was not in place early on, the spec still allows this. That said, it is still expected that double colons are used.\n\n\nA few examples:\n\n::after - This creates an inline pseudo-element as the lst child of an element.\n\n::before - Similar to the above, this creates an inline pseudo-element as the first child of an element.\n\n::first-letter - This will apply styles to the first letter of the first line of an element.\n\n::first-line - This works like ::first-letter, but the style will apply to the whole line. What qualifies for the first line will depend on the width of the element, font size and other similar factors.\n\n::selection - When the user highlights a section, usually by clicking and dragging the mouse across text, we can style this highlighted area using the ::selection pseudo-element.\n\n\nDrop this example into an online editor, like https://codepen.io/pen/, to see a few of the pseudo-elements work their magic:\n\nCSS\n\tp::first-letter {\n\t\tfont-size: 50px;\n\t}\n\n\tp::first-line {\n\t\tcolor: orange;\n\t\tletter-spacing: 0.5em;\n\t}\n\n\tp::before {\n\t\tcontent: 'THIS IS BEFORE ---- ';\n\t\tcolor: darkblue;\n\t\tbackground-color: yellowgreen;\n\t}\n\n\tp::after {\n\t\tcontent: '--- THIS IS AFTER';\n\t\tbackground: gray;\n\t\tcolor: aquamarine;\n\t}\n\n\nHTML\n\t<p>The first line will be orange and have letter-spacing applied. The first line changes as the element size changes. The resat of the line will be black, except for the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements. \n\t</p>\n\n",

            "A Promise is basically a placeholder for the results of a request. We can then use handlers based on the eventual success or failure of the request. Promises allow values to be returned much like synchronous methods, just not immediately. In the interim, the Promise, acting as the placeholder, allow the program to move on and will then provide the results of the request whenever they are ready.\n\nA Promise is always either:\n\n    pending: This is the default state. No value is ready nor has anything been rejected.\n    fulfilled: This means the request was completed successfully and the results will be returned.\n    rejected: As it sounds, the operation failed. This will return a reason for the rejection.\n\nA few approaches to handle the results of Promises, we can either chain then() methods with a catch() or use Async/Await. Note: If using Async/Await, it is a good idea to wrap it in a try-catch block to handle a possible rejection.",

          answer:
            'From Wikipedia:\n\nIn computing, tree shaking is a dead code elimination technique that is applied when optimizing code written in ECMAScript dialects like Dart, JavaScript, or TypeScript into a single bundle that is loaded by a web browser. Rather than eliminating code that can never be executed, tree shaking starts from entry point and includes only the code that is guaranteed to be executed.[1] It is succinctly described as "live code inclusion".\nHistory\n\nDead code elimination in dynamic languages is a much harder problem than in static languages. The idea of a "treeshaker" originated in LISP[2] in the 1990s. The idea is that all possible execution flows of a program can be represented as a tree of function calls, so that functions that are never called can be eliminated.\n\nThe algorithm was applied to JavaScript in Google Closure Tools and then to Dart in the dart2js compiler also written by Google, presented by Bob Nystrom in 2012[3][4] and described by the book "Dart in Action" by author Chris Buckett in 2013:\n\n    When code is converted from Dart to JavaScript the compiler does \'tree shaking\'. In JavaScript you have to add an entire library even if you only need it for one function, but thanks to tree shaking the Dart-derived JavaScript only includes the individual functions that you need from a library\n    — Chris Buckett\n\nThe next wave of popularity of the term is attributed to Rich Harris\'s Rollup project[5] developed in 2015.\nRelation to ECMAScript 6 modules\n\nThe popularity of tree shaking in JavaScript is based on the fact that in distinction from CommonJS modules, ECMAScript 6 module loading is static and thus the whole dependency tree can be deduced by statically parsing the syntax tree. Thus tree shaking becomes an easy problem. However, tree shaking does not only apply at the import/export level: it can also work at the statement level, depending on the implementation.[citation needed] ',

            "A clip from:\nhttps://www.katalon.com/resources-center/blog/ci-cd-introduction/\n\n\nCI/CD is the acronym for the combined practices of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). CI/CD practices are currently the most widely accepted choice to shorten software development and delivery cycle time.\n\n\nWhat is Continuous Integration?\n\nIn a CI practice, developers build, run, and test code on their own workstations before committing code to the version control repository. After changes are made to the repository, a chain of events is put into motion. A typical first step in this chain is to build the latest version of source code. If the build is successful, unit tests are executed. If unit testing succeeds, the build is deployed to test environments where system tests are performed (usually using automated tests). The team is notified about the status of this process, and a report is delivered to provide details, such as build number, defects, and the number of tests.\n\n\nWhat is Continuous Delivery?\n\nCD makes it possible to release builds to the production environment when needed. Allowing the team to deploy at will, CD effectively reduces time to market.\n\nBefore deploying software to production, the CD process includes performing automated system testing, unit testing (including API testing and load testing), and integration testing. The steps from CI to CD are usually completed automatically, including automated testing at the unit, integration, and system levels. As tests can fail at any level and environment, CI/CD must include a feedback channel to quickly report failures to developers.",

"I am a hard worker" followed up with how teammates always know, perhaps even commented, that we would get the job done and meet deadlines. Perhaps a bit about how some colleagues have become good friends. Maybe a little highlighting of how a boss liked to throw complicated or new things at us because he or she knew how well we can handle ourselves. This will all, of course, be personal and unique, but the general idea is just to showcase the positive affects that our personality, work ethic and passion have had on the people we worked with and the companies we worked for.\n\n\n',

            'This question is sometimes asked because it is more of an intermediate to advanced topic, given that it deals with both how things are layered, how an element\'s parent affects this and how the position property setting can change things.\n\n\tHere are the basics to know:\n\t- z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky).\n\n\t- Elements usually stack with the items that are lower in the DOM appearing on top. z-index can change that for an element using a integer. The higher the number, the higher it goes on the element stack.\n\n\t- Understanding how the parent-child relationship works is very important for understanding how z-index will affect the elements. If element A has children, but element B sits on top of it, then no child element A can ever be higher than element B. No matter how high we make the z-index setting. \n\n\t- You can animate z-index, but it is either behind or in front of an element. It will not transition from one to the other. \n\n\tAn example that can be dropped into an online editor like https://codepen.io/pen/ :\n\n\n\t\tCSS\n\t\t\tdiv {\n\t\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\t\tbackground: black;\n\t\t\tcolor: white;\n\t\t\twidth: 100%;\n\t\t\ttop: 35%;\n\t\t\ttext-align: center;\n\t\t\tpadding: 1em\n\t\t}\n\n\t\timg {\n\t\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\t\tleft: 25%;\n\t\t\ttop: 0;\n\t\t\tz-index: -1;\n\t\t\tmargin: 0 auto;\n\t\t}\n\n\n\t\tHTML\n\t\t    <div><h1>Toggle the image\'s z-index property to watch it go backwards and forwards.</h1>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random" width="50%">\n',

[1] A/B tests consist of a randomized experiment with two variants, A and B.[2][3] It includes application of statistical hypothesis testing or "two-sample hypothesis testing" as used in the field of statistics. A/B testing is a way to compare two versions of a single variable, typically by testing a subject\'s response to variant A against variant B, and determining which of the two variants is more effective.[4] \n\n\nHere is a nice excerpt from this article:\nhttps://crossbrowsertesting.com/blog/visual-testing/ab-testing-screenshots/\n\n"One of the more common testing practices that marketers experiment with is A/B testing, which lets you test two scenarios at once to determine which your audience responds to better.

          question: "",
          answer:
            'A very complete answer from:\nhttps://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-create-a-multicolor-text-in-html-and-css.html\n\nYou can create a multicolor text with the help of image editors such as Pixelmator, Photoshop and so on. So, you can create a multicolor image and embed it into your website.\nThe multicolor text will not be searchable with this method.\n\nAs a result, your code will look like the following:\n\n<img src="multicolortext.png"/>\n\nMake separate elements¶\n\nAnother way is creating a text with separate elements by using the HTML <span> tag, which is an empty container. This means that you create a multicolor text by putting each letter in a separate element to define a different color for each letter of your text.\nExample of creating a multicolor text with separate elements in HTML:¶\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Title of the document</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <span style="color:#FF0000">H</span>\n    <span style="color:#66CC66">e</span>\n    <span style="color:#FF9966">l</span>\n    <span style="color:#FFCCCC">l</span>\n    <span style="color:#FF0066">o</span>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\nTry it Yourself »\nResult¶\nUse CSS¶\n\nAnd finally, you can use CSS. This is the easiest way of creating such kind of text.\n\nPut your text in a <span> tag and give it a class name "multicolortext". Then, you need the CSS background-image property to add a gradient background to your text with its "linear-gradient" value, where you put the names of your preferred colors.\n\nTo get multicolor text instead of the multicolor background, you need to use the background-clip property, which lets you control how far a background image or color extends beyond the element\'s padding or content. This step gives some colors to your text, but not exactly what you want.\n\nYou can get the final result by making your text color transparent with the color property so that the background color will be reflected in the text.\nExample of creating a multicolor text with HTML and CSS:¶\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>The title of the document</title>\n    <style>\n      .multicolortext {\n        background-image: linear-gradient(to left, violet, indigo, green, blue, yellow, orange, red);\n        -webkit-background-clip: text;\n        -moz-background-clip: text;\n        background-clip: text;\n        color: transparent;\n      }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>\n      <span class="multicolortext">Let’s be creative!</span>\n    </h1>\n  </body>\n</html>',

Adding to this with third-party API's experience, like the Braintree API, or Slack API, can help showcase real-world experience.\n\n\n\nA few options are:\n\t- Geolocations\n\n\t\t        if (navigator.geolocation) {\n\t\t            navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((pos) => {\n\t\t                console.log('Got Location', pos);\n\t\t            }, () => {\n\t\t                console.log('nope')\n\t\t            });\n\t\t        }\n\n\n\n- Media API: This API works for both audio and video. There are a number of methods including play() and pause() as well as load().\n\n- Text Track API: Picking up where the Media API leaves off, the Text Track API allows us to interact with text tracks (subtitles or captions) for the audio and videos.\n\n- Drag and Drop: There are a number of possibilities with this API. Among these, you can add  'draggable' attribute to allow a user to move an element then have event handlers in place on a drop zone so the browser knows where the element can be dropped.\n\n- History API: This spec gives developers more control of the user's browser session. Along with moving the the user forward or backward, we can check the length of the history and even add or remove entries. We can hold data enabling us to restore a page or just update the URL without refreshing the page.\n",

The goal for an answer to any question about accessibility is to show that we have a basic understanding combined with being able to about real-world use.\n\nAccessibility is no longer just something nice to incorporate, it is essential for making sure people, best practices and, in some cases, laws are being respected. \n\nA few accessibility features we can incorporate:\n\nThoughtful contrasting colors for people who have trouble seeing color. This allows them to see a difference between two colored areas.\n\nAria labels are important for signalling correct detail to screen readers.\n\nUsing tags instead of CSS properties, like <em> instead of font-weight, will signal to screen-readers the intent to emphasis. This can then be past along to the user.\nThere are tools available, like Lighthouse now included in Chrome Dev Tools, that can run scans and alert us to accessibility concerns.\n\n\nHere is an example of the <em> and an aria label:\n\n\n    <p>Hi my name is Sheev Palpatine, but you can call me <em>EMPORER DARTH SIDIOUS</em></p>\n\n    <button aria-label="Close Modal">Close</button>',

HTTP2 adds a number of features to manage the streams, but leaves old semantics untouched.\n\n\nHTTP/2 supports queries multiplexing, headers compression, priority and more intelligent packet streaming management.

This is usually not a good idea as it creates difficult to edit document with potentially inconsistent styling. It is important to separate concerns for multi-faceted projects like web pages.\n\n\t<h1 style="color: blue;">Example</h1>\n\n- <style> tags in the documents <head> can be used to assign selectors to declarations. The browser will then link classes used on the elements in the <body> to the selectors in the <style> tag. This will apply CSS to the page.\n\n\tThis is better than inline styles, but still not ideal as we are not separating the styling from the structure.\n\n\t<style>\n        .selector-name {\n            color: red;\n        }\n    </style>\n\n- The most versatile, clear and maintainable method is using external style sheets. We can bring these in using a <link> tag in the document\'s <head>. The browser will then using the selctors in the external style sheet to link to classes on the page elements and apply the associated declarations.\n\n\tThe most versatile, clear and maintainable because it enables a sheet, or sheets, with only CSS-related material. We can group selectors as we see fit and even separate them into separate sheets when the need arises. If anyone ever needs to jump in, they will have a much easier time finding what they need and making changes over the inline or <style> tag methods.\n\n\t<link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css">\n',

            "Many of us will naturally move between jobs and for a variety of reasons. This can sometimes be concerning for a company as they might think that makes us a short-term investment or, much worse, a bad investment due to some inability to get along with people or perform.\nThis question is our opportunity to remove these doubts. A simple explanation can go a long way, even if there was a bad situation and we can speak to how we learned from it.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with wanting to make more money or move up in role or even just find a culture that meshes better with our values, work ethic and/or future goals. We just need to give a brief reasoning that includes our thoughts surrounding big moves, our steps to work with our current employer before making th e moves and how those decisions ended up being good or, perhaps, lessons that we learned from those that did not.\n\nUltimately, we don't want to lie or give the impression we are trying to cover anything up. There are always reasons and many of them are good reasons. Taking advantage of opportunities for personal or professional advancement are definitely good reasons. On the other side, some reasons are lessons that are part of our growth.\n",

          answer:
            "This question is designed to see our thought process on this issue.\n\nHere are some basic steps for approaching a slow app:\n\n\t1. Define the specific problem. What, specifically is slow? Is the initial load slow? Are page transitions slow? Do the interactions, like menu animations, seem slow or choppy? Does this occur on only some browsers or devices? \n\n\t\tUltimately, the goal here is to get as clear a picture as possible as of each part that is slow. This enables us to find the best spots to begin drilling down.\n\n\t2. Narrow the scope: Next we want to take our drill-down points and begin to narrow each of those to as small a piece of code as we can. \n\n\t\tFor instance, if the issue is slow loading, a good place to start is either Chrome Dev Tools' Lighthouse tool or a page speed analyzer. One popular one is: \n\n\t\thttps://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/\n\n\t\tThese tools can help see where it is slow, like the first paint or how long until a user can actually interact with the page. From there it can help us pinpoint potential problem areas, like large images or slow server response.\n\n\t\tin a browser's dev tools we can use other tools, like the Network section to see detail on specific items like when they loaded, how long they took and if they were blocking progress. \n\n\t\tIf the issue is something not related to resources loading, dev tools can help narrow down the search using the Debugger, Performance, Inspector, Console and others. \n\n\t3. Isolate: Once we gained an understanding of the specific symptoms and then narrowed the scope of our attention, we can now address these specific areas of code. Dev tools Debugger can be great for stepping through JavaScript. The Performance tool can help see how an animation affects the page processing. \n\n\t\tIf need be, it can help to isolate specific blocks of code in a separate editor, perhaps even an online editor like repl.it, codepen.io or jsbin.com. This can help zero-in on specific problems in the code.\n\t\tAlong the same line of thinking, commenting out blocks of code and/or temporarily inserting new simplified code can help ensure we have properly identified the problem area.\n\n\t4. Fix: By this point, we have arrived at the problem pieces of code. Now, we just need to correct the issue.\n\n\t5. Test...a lot: We have not fixed the problem at this point. We have only written the code that we think will correct the issue. Test. Test. Test then take a break...test again. At that point, we have fixed teh issue.",

            'There are a wide array of strategies for this answer. Below are a few basic approaches, though a web search (click the "More About this Question" button for that) will yield a wealth of detail and other options.\n\n- We can just give an amount we would like to make and we think we are worth. it is simple and direct, though it might be a factor in eliminating us from the candidate list if the number far exceeds what the company wants to spend on the position or thinks we are worth. This approach is not concerned with staying in market value. It is more about weeding out companies that can not or do not wish to pay what we value our services at. \n\n- We can take our current salary and just raise that a little. Assuming we are applying for a similar position, or even slightly elevated, this keeps us around market range. \n\n- If the job is meant to be an entry into a new career, pushing for more money might hurt the greater purpose. We might want to consider looking for the salary range listed in the job post and speaking to an amount towards the middle, with a minimum around the listed minimum. Or, perhaps, if our situation is one where little more or less would not matter and getting in the door is the focus, being honest about this can be OK. It would be best to also ask how soon someone is eligible for a raise and to make sure they do not offer below their posted minimum. There are some who would say never ask for or imply the offered minimum, but getting the first foot in can make a tremendous difference and then enable us to make the next interview about what we are really worth.\n\n- Use online tools to find a market salary range and then ask for a salary somewhere between the average and the top salary depending on where our skills and experience put us.\n\n\n\tA few tools for finding market value:\n\n\t\tGlassDoor: https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/index.htm\n\t\tPayScale: https://www.payscale.com/my/survey/choose\n\t\tLinkedin Salary Tool: https://www.linkedin.com/salary/',

          answer:
            'This answer comes from:\nhttps://resource-centre.net/html5-tutorials/bullet-point-lists/\n\nBullet Point Lists (or Unordered Lists)\n\nThe first kind of list we will look at is using bullets.\nUnordered List – the <ul> Tag\n\nBullet point lists are also known as unordered lists (UL) because there is no numbering involved. That is why a bulleted list uses the <ul> </ul> tag pair. Here is a basic example:\n\nThe whole list is surrounded by <ul> </ul> for a start. When you open your list tag, make sure you automatically type your closing tag and then proceed to fill your items between them.\nThe type Attribute\n\nThe type attribute determines what kind of bullet you are seeing on the page. Although through CSS you can specify a wide-range of bullet styles, and even use your own image, in raw HTML it is best to stick with the common types which are\n\n    type="circle" – an unfilled circle\n\n    type="disc" – a filled circle\n\n    type="square" – a filled square\n\nList Items – the <li> Tag\n\nEach individual item in your list is wrapped in its own <li> </li> tag pair. You can often get away without the </li> but I would recommend keeping it in, just so you maintain healthy coding habit.\n\nThe list above I placed in individual <ul> but each <li> also supports the type attribute, such that I could create\n\n    Square\n    Disc\n    Circle\n\nNot sure why you would want to do that, but you can if you want to!\n\nBullet List Indentation\n\nBefore you apply any CSS to your list, HTML (or more accurately, your browser) will apply indentation to your list, so it stands out from your normal paragraph <p> tags.\nOrdered / Numbered Lists – the <ol> Tag\n\nIf you want to present your list in an ordered fashion, then the <ol> tag is your friend. By default this will give you a numbered list, but the type attribute gives you flexibility, in the same way as bullet point lists do.\n\nwhich outputs\n\n    Item 1\n    Item 2\n    Item 3\n\nThe type attribute offers a few more options in ordered lists compared to bulleted ones. A bit more guidance on this can be obtained at W3Schools.\nStarting an Ordered List On A Different Number\n\nSay you were putting together some instructions to build a table. You may want to use a numbered list to achieve this. However, if you wanted to put images and extra text between each stage, you would probably need multiple lists. The problem is that each list starts at number 1 (or letter A) by default. That would screw up your instructions!\n\nThankfully HTML has the start property to allow you to start on a subsequent number:\n\nThis outputs:\n\n    Step Four\n    Step Five\n    Step Six\n\nReversing The Order\n\nIf you want to show your numbers (or letters) in reverse order, then this is really easy too. You might want to do a ‘Top 10’ with your best item announced last, for example. This can be done by adding the word reversed into your Ordered List opening tag:\n\nAnd this would make your list look like this:\n\n    First LI\n    Second LI\n    Third LI\n    Fourth LI\n    Fifth LI\n\nMulti-Level Bullet List in HTML\n\nWith patchy browser support (and sometimes undone by CSS in some sites) you can create a multilevel list. This is achieved by embedding one list inside another:\n\nWhich creates:\n\n    Top Level Item\n        Sub-Item 1\n        Sub-Item 2\n    Top Level Item\n\nYou can use a combination of <ul> and <ol>. That may be useful if you want bullet points under a numbered list.\n\n    Top Level Item\n        Sub-Item 1\n        Sub-Item 2\n    Top Level Item\n',

          answer:
            'The following excerpt come from bitofco.de:\nhttps://bitsofco.de/understanding-the-virtual-dom/\n\nWhy do we need a virtual DOM?\n\nTo understand why the concept of the virtual DOM arose, let’s revisit the original DOM. As I mentioned, there are two parts to the DOM - the object-based representation of the HTML document and the API to manipulating that object.\n\nFor example, let’s take this simple HTML document with an unordered list and one list item.\n\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang="en">\n <head></head>\n <body>\n    <ul class="list">\n        <li class="list__item">List item</li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\n\nThis document can be represented as the following DOM tree:\n\nhtml\nhead lang="en"\nbody\nul class="list"\nli class="list__item"\n"List item"\n\nLet’s say we want to modify the content of the first list item to \n"List item one"\n and also add a second list item. To do this, we will need use the DOM APIs to find the elements we want to update, create the new elements, add attributes and content, then finally update the DOM elements themselves.\n\nconst listItemOne = document.getElementsByClassName("list__item")[0];\nlistItemOne.textContent = "List item one";\n\nconst list = document.getElementsByClassName("list")[0];\nconst listItemTwo = document.createElement("li");\nlistItemTwo.classList.add("list__item");\nlistItemTwo.textContent = "List item two";\nlist.appendChild(listItemTwo);\n\nThe DOM wasn’t made for this…\n\nWhen the first specification for the DOM was released in 1998, we built and managed web pages in very differently. There was far less reliance on the DOM APIs to create and update the page content as frequently as we do today.\n\nSimple methods such as \ndocument.getElementsByClassName()\n are fine to use on a small scale, but if we are updating multiple elements on a page every few seconds, it can start to become really expensive to constantly query and update the DOM.\n\nEven further, because of the way the APIs are setup, it is usually simpler to perform more expensive operations where we update larger parts of the document than to find and update the specific elements. Going back to our list example, it is in some ways easier to replace the entire unordered list with a new one than to modify the specific elements.\n\nconst list = document.getElementsByClassName("list")[0];\nlist.innerHTML = `\n<li class="list__item">List item one</li>\n<li class="list__item">List item two</li>\n`;\n\n\nIn this particular example, the performance difference between the methods is probably insignificant. However, as the size of the web page grows, it becomes more important to only select and update what is needed.\n\n… but the virtual DOM was!\n\nThe virtual DOM was created to solve these problems of needing to frequently update the DOM in a more performant way. Unlike the DOM or the shadow DOM, the virtual DOM isn\'t an official specification, but rather a new method of interfacing with the DOM.\n\nA virtual DOM can be thought of as a copy of the original DOM. This copy can be frequently manipulated and updated, without using the DOM APIs. Once all the updates have been made to the virtual DOM, we can look at what specific changes need to be made to the original DOM and make them in a targetted and optimised way.',

            'Meta tags are used in an HTML document to provide detail about the specific document. This could be to provide context, like to credit the page author, or detail for search engine optimization (SEO), or any info that can be helpful to pass along, but does not belong in the content of the rendered page. This information can be minor detail or even to instruct the browser to treat the document differently, like on the "viewport" settings to make a page responsive or "refresh" to have the page refresh at a certain interval.\n\nHere are a few  meta info samples:\n\n    <meta chartset="UTF-8">\n\n    <meta description="Meta Tag Example">\n\n    <meta keywords="html, head, meta, tags">\n\n    <meta author="Ben Solo">\n\n    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">\n\n    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">',

            "Questions about components can usually be answered either generally or specific to a framework, if we choose. We just need to demonstrate an understanding of the core concepts.\n\nThere have been the addition of web components native to the browser. modern frameworks have already had components built in for a while.\n\nA component will usually have an HTML template that we can pass in properties or other data. This allows us to build a component once and then use it multiple times. \n\nCommon uses are a navigation menu or model or buttons. These components can really be anything that we might want to use multiple times.\n\nEach component is encapsulated to ensure internal code will not collide with any document they are used in.\n\n\n\nWeb Component example from MDN (frameworks' syntax can be different):\n\nThis would be in a word-count.js file:\n\n// Create a class for the element\nclass WordCount extends HTMLParagraphElement {\n  constructor() {\n    // Always call super first in constructor\n    super();\n\n    // count words in element's parent element\n    const wcParent = this.parentNode;\n\n    function countWords(node){\n      const text = node.innerText || node.textContent;\n      return text.split(/\\s+/g).length;\n    }\n\n    const count = `Words: ${countWords(wcParent)}`;\n\n    // Create a shadow root\n    const shadow = this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});\n\n    // Create text node and add word count to it\n    const text = document.createElement('span');\n    text.textContent = count;\n\n    // Append it to the shadow root\n    shadow.appendChild(text);\n\n    // Update count when element content changes\n    setInterval(function() {\n      const count = `Words: ${countWords(wcParent)}`;\n      text.textContent = count;\n    }, 200);\n  }\n}\n\n// Define the new element\ncustomElements.define('word-count', WordCount, { extends: 'p' });\n\n\n\nHere is how to use it in a document:\n<script src=\"word-count.js\"></script>\n<p is=\"word-count\"></p>",

In some cases, authentication can be part of this connection. This might be a JSON web token, or some other data, included in the request.\n- The server will then send the requested data to the browser.\n- The browser will then render the page to the screen. \n\n- The new web page might include dependencies, like CSS ot JavaScript sheets, or images, etc. The browser will then either request these via the same connection, or, if the begin the process for a new connection to retrieve each item.\n\n- Once the browser page (tab or window) is closed, the connection to the server ends.\n\n",

Our goal is to show that we not only have dealt with conflict but that we have thought about it and worked through the difficult aspects. The worst thing we can do is not have an answer, or say we have never encountered any conflict. That is not realistic and it leaves the question wide open as to what they can expect from us if we encounter conflict while working there. Even a story about how we handled conflict poorly is fine, as long as we can talk clearly about how we thought and felt at the time and how we eventually learned how to handle it all better. \n\nTo put it simply:\n\tBe human. \n\tShow growth. \n\tShow thought. \n\tShow intent to understand others, even if they are acting poorly. \n\tShow a desire to explore the finer points of human interaction.\n\tShow that all of the above maters enough to have carefully thought about it.\n",

W3C\'s standards define key parts of what makes the World Wide Web work. Learn more about W3C\'s mission.\nWhere is W3C located?\n\nW3C does not have a single physical headquarters. There are four institutions, however, that "host" W3C: MIT (in Cambridge, MA, USA), ERCIM (in Sophia-Antipolis, France), Keio University (near Tokyo, Japan), and Beihang University (in Beijing, China).\n\nThe W3C staff is distributed around the world, but there are concentrations of people in Cambridge, Massachusetts (USA), Sophia-Antipolis (France), and Tokyo (Japan). In addition, W3C is represented in 17 other regions of the world via representatives based at organizations. W3C calls these regional points of contact "W3C Offices."\nHow is W3C funded?\n\nW3C receives funds from:\n\n    W3C Member dues\n    Research grants and other sources of private and public funding\n    Individual donations of money and equipment \n\nWhat is the difference between the Web and the Internet?\n\nFrom the definition in the Wikipedia: "The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that interchange data by packet switching using the standardized Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)."\n\nThus, the Internet is a network of networks, defined by the TPC/IP standards.\n\nThe Web, on the other hand, is defined in W3C\'s Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume I as follows: "The World Wide Web (WWW, or simply Web) is an information space in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI)."\n\nThus, the Web is an information space.

            "What is async, defer, preload and prefetch for loading JavaScript documents",
          answer:
            'All of this addresses the loading of documents and how they affect the main document.\n\nFrom:https://javascript.info/script-async-defer\n\n\nDEFER:\n\nThe defer attribute tells the browser not to wait for \nthe script. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, \nbuild DOM. The script loads “in the background”, and then runs when the \nDOM is fully built.\n\nHere’s the same example with defer:\n<p>...content before script...</p>\n\n<scrip/t defer src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js?speed=1"></scrip/t>\n\n<!-- visible immediately -->\n<p>...content after script...</p>\n\n\nIn other words:\n\n    - Scripts with defer never block the page.\n    - Scripts with defer always execute when the DOM is ready (but before DOMContentLoaded event).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASYNC\n\nThe async attribute is somewhat like \ndefer. It also makes the script non-blocking. But it has important differences in the behavior.\n\nThe async attribute means that a script is completely independent:\n\n    - The browser doesn’t block on async scripts (like defer).\n    - Other scripts don’t wait for async scripts, and async scripts don’t wait for them.\n    - DOMContentLoaded and async scripts don’t wait for each other:\n        | DOMContentLoaded may happen both before an async script (if an async script finishes loading after the page is complete)\n        | …or after an async script (if an async script is short or was in HTTP-cache)\n\n    <p>...content before scripts...</p>\n\n    <scrip/t>\n      document.addEventListener(\'DOMContentLoaded\', () => alert("DOM ready!"));\n    </scrip/t>\n\n    <scrip/t async src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js"></scrip/t>\n    <scrip/t async src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/small.js"></scrip/t>\n\n    <p>...content after scripts...</p>\n\n\n\nThe following examples come from: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/html-preload-prefetch\n\n\n    \nPRELOAD\n\nPreloading JavaScript resources is done differently. This example, taken from this Google Developers article on preloading, shows this:\nindex.html\n\n<link rel="preload" href="used-later.js" as="scrip/t">\n<!-- ... -->\n<scrip/t>\n  var usedLaterScript = document.createElement(\'script\');\n  usedLaterScript.src = \'used-later.js\';\n  document.body.appendChild(usedLaterScript);\n</scrip/t>\n\n\n\nPREFETCH\n\nPrefetching works similarly to preloading. The difference is that, \nwhen prefetching a resource, the browser considers the resource to be \nlow priority. This means that the resource or asset will load a bit \nlater. Because of this, prefetching is usually implemented with \nresources that are not required initially, but are used at a later \npoint.\n\nTo implement prefectching in your HTML page, change the value of \nrel to "prefetching.\n\nindex.html\n<link\n  rel="prefetch"\n  as="style"\n  onload="this.rel = \'stylesheet\'"\n  href=\'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:100,900|Material+Icons\'>\n',

          answer:
            'This is generally asked to get an idea of how much someone pays attention to good practices and, ultimately, will write easier to understand code and have an easier time jumping into someone else\'s code.\n\nGeneral naming conventions:\n-\tNames should be brief, but descriptive enough that the average non-developer could understand. For example, using "d = new Date()" might serve brevity, but can make no sense later in the program and require extra effort to understand. Conversely, "theDateForTheDayTheAppIsRun = new Date()" is clear, but unnecessarily long. Simply "todaysDate = new Date()" is brief and easily understood.\n\nA few JavaScript examples can be:\n- Camel case for variables: const lastName = \'Kenobi\'\n- Pascal case for classes: class MainCharacter { }\n- "is" or "has" prefix for booleans.\n- Function calls that will be returning something can start with have a descriptive verb ("update", "get", etc).\n- As few variables as possible. This is not really a naming convention, but it greatly affects the abilty for the names of the variables that do get used to be easier to follow and keep track of.\n- Do not re-use variable names.\n- In many cases it is better not to make a variable equal itself with modification. This can be difficult to follow through and can often be better served with a new, variable descriptively named to match the newly formed data.\n- When reasonable, if a specific item in an array is being used, assign a more descriptive variable: const updatedFileId = changes[0]\n- Property names that do not need to be prefixed with the class name. \n\tWe do not need: class Car {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructor(brand, purchaseDate) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.carName = brand;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.carYear = purchaseDate;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n} \n\tInstead, we can use: class Car {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructor(brand) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.name = brand;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.year = purchaseDate;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t} \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t// in use it will still be descriptive\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconst myCar = new Car();\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmyCar,name = \'Jeep\';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmyCar.year = \'2017\';\n- Avoid "magic" numbers, or numbers without a name, when possible. \n\tWe want to avoid: const forwardMovement = duration * 3;\n\tWe can use: const rate = 3;\n\t\t\t\t  forwardMovement = duration * rate;\n\t\t\t\t \n\nCSS & HTML examples:\n- Use nicely cascading rules to make for as few selectors as possible.\n- Kabab case for selectors: .inner-wrap\n- Descriptive selector names. This can be the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) method or similar.\n- Try to avoid using the same name for an ID and a class. These are technically independent from each other, but this can cause confusion for a developer.\n',

            'The rest parameter syntax allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array, providing a way to represent variadic functions in JavaScript. This is often not ideal, as we are generally better off knowing how many parameters we will be passing, but for the occasions where we do not, the Rest operator makes for a clean, readable and powerful tool.\n\n\nfunction sum(...theArgs) {\n  let total = 0;\n  for (const arg of theArgs) {\n    total += arg;\n  }\n  return total;\n}\n\nconsole.log(sum(1, 2, 3));\n// Expected output: 6\n\nconsole.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4));\n// Expected output: 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spread (...) syntax allows an iterable, such as an array or string, to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected. In an object literal, the spread syntax enumerates the properties of an object and adds the key-value pairs to the object being created.\n\nSpread syntax looks exactly like rest syntax. In a way, spread syntax is the opposite of rest syntax. Spread syntax "expands" an array into its elements, while rest syntax collects multiple elements and "condenses" them into a single element. See rest parameters and rest property.\n\nfunction sum(x, y, z) {\n\n  return x + y + z;\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3];\n\n\n\n\nconsole.log(sum(...numbers));\n\n// Expected output: 6\n\n\n\n\nconsole.log(sum.apply(null, numbers));\n\n// Expected output: 6\n\n\n',

          answer:
            'This might sound like a silly question, but questions like this sometimes are used to get us to show our understanding of basic, but often needed, aspects of CSS. This will usually be a screening question, so a descriptive verbal outline will needed, not actual code.\n\nTo begin, we need to target our element via ID, or by class for multiple elements. We then want to set an equal width and height, perhaps 100px each. From there, we can either set the border for a few pixels or a background color or even both. This way we can see it. At that point, we have a square.\n\nMaking that square a circle simply requires a border-radius of 50% all of the way around. \n\nNow, that is a fixed width square or circle. We could make it responsive by using a percentage as the width and an equal percentage as padding-bottom. If there is content in the square or circle, one way to keep the sides equal would be to absolutely position the content. Ultimately, this is just an option. There are many ways to approach graphics in CSS, and purpose and the rest of the document will play into a plan for making the graphics responsive.\n\n\nPaste this example into an online editor, like https://codepen.io/pen/, to see the square and circle:\n\n\tCSS\n\t\t.square {\n\t\t\tbackground: lightgreen;\n\t\t\twidth: 50%;\n\t\t\tpadding-bottom: 50%;\n\t\t\tmargin: 0 auto;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t.square.circle {\n\t\t\tborder-radius: 50%;\n\t\t\tbackground: salmon;\n\t\t}\n\n\tHTML\n\t\t<div class="square"></div>\n\n\t\t<div class="square circle"></div>',

            "The days of great consideration being paid to Internet Explorer's many differences will, or possibly have, come to an end. This does not mean browser compatibility is no longer a concern. \nModern browsers are much more consistent with including features, but it is still good to check with a tool like https://caniuse.com/ or MDN to make sure new features are well covered.\n\nFor most browsers, we can easily download them and test our app. But what about older versions of each browser? What about these browsers on different devices. What if we need to test on Safari, but do not have access to a Mac? There are tools like https://www.browserstack.com/ to test web apps in many different ways. Some will even monitor real users on different browsers and devices. We can even have automated routines to test these scenarios.  \n\nBeyond testing, it is important that we know well what our target audience is going to be. If it is truly a global reach we are seeking, we need to consider things like Opera Mini (popular in parts of the world with slow internet), Baidu (a popular China-based browser), KaiOS' browser (mobile OS and browser used all over and especially in India) and any others that are used.\n\nAll of this does not mean that wide-reach intentions mean we need to remove most of our JavaScript just to make the app work right on Opera Mini. It just means just that we need to consider what happens to our product for the those users and work towards good solutions. \n\nWhithin any app, we should pay attention to current browser compatibility and utilize thinking along these lines:\n\n\t- We might just need to ensure there are fullbacks in place.\n\n\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\tposition: sticky; // Not fully supported by some browsers\n\n\t- We can plan our interactions and layouts so that nothing critical relies on technology not fully supported.\t\n\n\t- We can check for specific feature support in a browser and have separate functionality ready. This is not ideal as it requires extra consideration when maintaining the web app, but it is a workable solution.\n\n\t- We and the customer can consider the costs vs the gains related to supporting certain browsers. The benefits might not offset the costs of supporting a specific browser's use and/or the areas of the world it is popular.",

            'Some browsers accept additional proprietary non-standard non-css syntax on top of the usual css. Less is build on top of standard css and therefore may not recognize it. You may also need to put an otherwise non-parseable value inside a variable and use it to dynamically build selector or other css part during compilation time.\n\nEscaping allows you to use any arbitrary string as property or variable value. It can be used also to dynamically build selectors, but that feature is deprecated and replaced by different more powerful option.\n\nSyntax\n\nUse either ~"whatever" or ~\'whatever\' syntax to escape property values. Anything between quotes is used as is with almost no changes. The "as is" rule has one exception: string interpolation works with the usual @{variableName} syntax.\n\nUsed as Property Value\n\nSample input:\n\n@variable: "dynamic";\nh1 {\n  margin: 1 ~"2 2" 3;\n  padding: ~\'ms:special.syntax()\';\n  text: ~\'@{variable}\'; //interpolation works\n}\n\ncompiles into:\n\nh1 {\n  margin: 1 2 2 3;\n  padding: ms:special.syntax();\n  text: dynamic;\n}\n\n',

            "Excerpts from hacker.io:\n\nCSS was originally released in 1996 and consists of properties for adding font properties such as typeface and emphasis color of text, backgrounds, and other elements. CSS2 was released in 1998 with added styles for other media types so that it can be used for page layout designing. CSS3 was released in 1999 and presentation-style properties were added in it that allows you to build a presentation from documents.\n\nUnlike CSS2, which was comprised of a single document, CSS3 has its specifications divided into many individual modules, which makes CSS3 a whole lot easier to handle.\n\nWith CSS3, the designers can now use special fonts, like those available in Google Fonts and Typecast. Earlier, with CSS and CSS2, designers could only use “web-safe fonts” for being 100% sure to use fonts that would always display the same on every machine.\n\nWhile CSS and CSS2 had ‘simple selectors’, CSS3 calls the components as ‘a sequence of simple selectors’.\n\nCSS3 came up with some key web design considerations like rounded borders that help in rounding up the borders without any hassle. This turned out to be a huge plus point for developers who were struggling with initial versions of CSS borders.\n\nCSS3 has the capability to split text sections into multiple columns so that it can be read like a newspaper. In CSS2, the developers had difficulty because the standard was not equipped with automatically breaking the text so that it fits within a box.\n\n",

This means the rest of the program (and end user) wait until the program can mover on to the next line. This is where asynchronous code can be helpful.\n\nAsynchronous code runs separately from other code. This means it can take longer to process without "blocking" the rest of the program from running. In JavaScript, the Call Stack processes code synchronously. If a piece of asynchronous code is encountered, it is moved out of the Call Stack. If it is part of a Web API, like setTimeOut(), then the browser handles the resolving the code. Otherwise, it is moved to the Callback Que. In either case, the Event Loop will take the next item that has resolved, and place it on the Call Stack. This time, when the code can be dealt with in order because it is ready and will not block the processing the rest of the program.',

            "You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:\n\nstruct Node {\n  int val;\n  Node *left;\n  Node *right;\n  Node *next;\n}\nPopulate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.\n\nInitially, all next pointers are set to NULL.\n\n \n\nFollow up:\n\nYou may only use constant extra space.\nRecursive approach is fine, you may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.\n \n\nExample 1:\n\n      1                  1   -> null\n     /  \\              /   \\  \n    /    \\            /     \\\n  2       3          2------>3  -> null\n / \\     / \\        / \\     / \\\n4   5   6   7      4-->5   6-->7  -> null\n\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]\nOutput: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#]\n\nExplanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the given tree is less than 4096.\n-1000 <= node.val <= 1000",

            "A few basic elements of design are:    \n\n\nLINE – The linear marks made with a pen or brush or the edge created when two shapes meet.    \n\n\nSHAPE – A shape is a self contained defined area of geometric (squares and circles), or organic (free formed shapes or natural shapes). A positive shape automatically creates a negative shape.    \n\n\nDIRECTION – All lines have direction – Horizontal, Vertical or Oblique. Horizontal suggests calmness, stability and tranquility. Vertical gives a feeling of balance, formality and alertness. Oblique suggests movement and action    \n\n\nSIZE – Size is simply the relationship of the area occupied by one shape to that of another.    \n\n\nTEXTURE – Texture is the surface quality of a shape – rough, smooth, soft hard glossy etc.    \n\n\nCOLOR – Color is light reflected off objects. Color has three main characteristics: hue or its name (red, green, blue, etc.), value (how light or dark it is), and intensity (how bright or dull it is).",

          answer:
            "Closure is an inner function, that is accessible outside of its parent function's scope while maintaining its connection to the parent's variables and other data. This can be don to keep some data private and purposely expose other data.\nTo accomplish this, an anonymous function can be immediately invoked. In this function, data we wish to keep  private can be processed. Usually this data would be removed from memory via JavaScript's \"garbage collection\" memory clearing process. If this function returns a function, let's call it a child function, that accesses data from the parent function, the parent's data will remain in memory. In this situation, the only access to the parent function's data will be via whatever had been set up in the child function. In addition, every time the child function is invoked, a new function scope is created for the child function. The parent function scope is only created once. This means that we can invoke the child function to change a variable in the parent and the next time we invoke the child function the variable in the parent will still reflect the change. \n\nThis can be considered state management and might not be as useful today given other options to manage state. Still, this process can be used to protect sensitive data or even just a to keep a counter variable from being accidentally increased.\n\nSome examples\n// For comparison, this is a counter without closure\nlet counter = 0;\n\nfunction add1 () {\n\tcounter++;\n\treturn counter;\n}\n\nconsole.log(add1());  // 1\nconsole.log(add1());  // 2\n// The counter becomes unpredictable when it can be altered elswhere\ncounter++;\nconsole.log(add1());  // 4\n\n\n// This is a counter with closure\nconst add1 = (function () {\n  let counter = 0;\n\n  return function () {\n\tcounter++;\n\treturn counter;\n  };\n})();\nconsole.log(add1());  // 1\nconsole.log(add1());  // 2\nconsole.log(add1());  // 3\ncounter++;// error: counter is not defined\nconsole.log(add1());\n\n// Another, more complex example\n// In this travelAgent() in the child function made available, while \n// the \"trip\" variable and agent() function are accessible through \n// travelAgent(). The book() function, is only accessible through agent().\nfunction vacation() {\n\tvar trip;\n\n\tfunction travelAgent(itinerary) {\n\t\tagent(itinerary);\n\t\treturn trip;\n\t}\n\n\tfunction agent(itinerary) {\n\t\tif (itinerary === 'Orlando') {\n\t\t\ttrip = ['Orlando', 'Disney', 'Universal'];\n\t\t\tbook();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tfunction book() {\n\t\ttrip.push('booked');\n\t}\n\treturn travelAgent;\n}\n\nvar myVacation = vacation();\n\nconsole.log(myVacation('Orlando'));\n\n// Array [ \"Orlando\", \"Disney\", \"Universal\", \"booked\" ]\n",

            "S.O.L.I.D is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin.\n\nS - Single-responsiblity principle. A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.\n\nO - Open-closed principle. Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.\n\nL - Liskov substitution principle. Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.\n\nI - Interface segregation principle. A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.\n\nD - Dependency Inversion Principle. Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.\n\nHere is a good article on the subject: https://dev.to/francescoxx/solid-principles-in-javascript-3pek\n",

            'The best way to answer this question is with a bit of detail about each part of the process, though fine detail is not needed.\n- There are fonts available on the web, with Google Fonts being a common example. There are many other free and paid font sources. \n- We need to download the font documents or get a CDN URL.\n- These can be loaded ito our app via a <link> tag in our <head> section of our HTML sheet:\n\n\t<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Mulish:wght@200&display=swap" rel="stylesheet"> \n\n\tOr, using @import in our style sheet:\n\n\t@import url(\'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Mulish:wght@200&display=swap\');\n\n\n\tOr, if we wish to define a custom font typeface, we can do so using @font-face. This can be very useful, especially if the font is not a web font. For more info on @font-face and when to use it, check this out: \n\n\t\t\thttps://designmodo.com/font-face/\n\n\t\tFor detail on the difference between a typefacr and a font, read this:\n\n\t\t\thttps://www.howtogeek.com/325644/whats-the-difference-between-a-font-a-typeface-and-a-font-family/\n\n\t\tHere is how to set it up:\n\n\t\t@font-face {\n\t\t  font-family: "Open Sans";\n\t\t  src: url("/fonts/OpenSans-Regular-webfont.woff2") format("woff2"),\n\t\t       url("/fonts/OpenSans-Regular-webfont.woff") format("woff");\n\t\t}\n\n\t- We can apply any of the above using the following syntax in our style sheet:\n\n\t\tfont-family: \'Mulish\', sans-serif;\n',

          answer:
            "Advantages\n\n    Sass facilitates you to write clean, easy and less CSS in a programming construct.\n    It contains fewer codes so you can write CSS quicker.\n    It is more stable, powerful, and elegant because it is an extension of CSS. So, it is easy for designers and developers to work more efficiently and quickly.\n    It is compatible with all versions of CSS. So, you can use any available CSS libraries.\n    It provides nesting so you can use nested syntax and useful functions like color manipulation, math functions and other values.\n\nDisadvantages\n\n    The developer must have enough time to learn new features present in this preprocessor before using it.\n    Using Sass may result in the loss of some benefits of a browser's built-in element inspector.",

          answer:
            "This addresses what happens when passing data from one variable to another. More specifically, this is about where variables point. \n\nThe original variable points to a place in memory. The new variable can either point to the same place in memory, which means the reference to the data was passed, or the new variable can point to a new place in memory that contains the same data, which means the values were passed to the new memory location.\n\nThe main reason this is important is shown by the results of changing either variable. If only a reference was passed, meaning both variables point to the same data at the same memory location, then changing a value will change change it for both variables, as well as any others pointing to the same place in memory.\n\nIf the actual values were passed and reside at a new location in memory, changing the values at the new memory location will only be visible with the new variable (and any others pointing to that location). The original variable is still pointing at the old memory location and remains unchanged.\n\nExamples:\nlet example1 = 1;\nlet example2 = example1;\nexample2++;\n\nconsole.log(example1, ' - ', example2);\n\nconst example3 = {\n  weapon: 'lightsaber'\n};\nconst example4 = {\n  ...example3\n};\nexample4.name = 'Darth Vader';\nconsole.log(example3, ' - ', example4);",

It is positioned relative to the initial containing block established by the viewport, except when one of its ancestors has a transform, perspective, or filter property set to something other than none (see the CSS Transforms Spec), in which case that ancestor behaves as the containing block. (Note that there are browser inconsistencies with perspective and filter contributing to containing block formation.) Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left. \n\nThis value always creates a new stacking context.

Note that a sticky element "sticks" to its nearest ancestor that has a "scrolling mechanism" (created when overflow is hidden, scroll, auto, or overlay), even if that ancestor isn\'t the nearest actually scrolling ancestor.

          answer:
            'visibility: hidden makes the element not able to be seen, but it still occupies space the same as if it was visible. The flow of the document does not change at all when an element is hidden.\n\ndisplay: none actually removes the element from the document flow. This means the document\'s flow will now treat whatever space the element had been taking up as empty space.\n\n\n\nPop the below into an online editor, like https://codepen.io/, and then toggle both visibility:hidden and display:none to see the difference in real time.\n\n<html>\n\n\t<head>\n\t    <style>\n\t        div {\n\t            height: 150px;\n\t            width: 150px;\n\t        }\n\n\t        #green {\n\t        \tvisibility: hidden;\n\t            display: none;\n\t            background-color: green;\n\t        }\n\n\t        #red {\n\t            background-color: red;\n\t        }\n\t    </style>\n\t</head>\n\n\t<body>\n\t    <div id="green"></div>\n\t    <div id="red"></div>\n\t</body>\n\n</html>\n',

          answer:
            "Here is a video introduction to hooks:\nhttps://youtu.be/dpw9EHDh2bM\n\n\nHooks let you use state and other React features without writing a class.\n\n\nExample of the useState hook:\n\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Example() {\n  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call \"count\"  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\n        Click me\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nA few snippets from https://softwareontheroad.com/react-hooks/\n\n\n When you work with Reactjs class components you can use state, that’s why these components are also called stateful, also every class component has lifecycle methods like: componentDidMount(), componentDidUpdate(), and so on.\n\nYou can’t use any of this in functional components. Functional components can’t use their own state and don’t have lifecycle methods.\n\nNow with React hooks you can.\n\nReact hooks allows us to take a Reactjs functional component and add state and lifecycle methods to it.\n\nIn simple words, React hooks are special functions to extend the capabilities of functional components and give them the possibility to have lifecycle events and manage state.\n\n\nThe existing React hooks 🍱\n\nThe new API comes with two main pre-existing hooks, and some others for other use cases\nBasics React hooks\n\nThe foundation of all React hooks, every other hook you will see is a variation of these three or are using them as primitives.\n\n    useState is the State hook use it for declaring the state in your components\n    useEffect is the Side effects hook use it for data fetching, manually changing the DOM, and etc.\n    useContext use it in conjunction with Reactjs Context API. When the React Context provider updates, this hook will trigger render with the latest context value.\n\nAdvance React hooks\n\nThese are the most important of the other built-in React hooks that come with the library.\n\n    The useReducer is an alternative to useState, you should use it when you have complex state logic, if you’re familiar with Redux you will like it.\n    The useRef use it for accessing a DOM element with a mutable ref object. Is more useful than the ref attribute\n\n\n\nRules\n\n    Never call Hooks from inside a loop, condition or nested function\n    Never call a Hook from a regular function\n    Only call them inside functions components or custom hooks\n    Hooks should sit at the top level of your component\n    Hooks can call other Hooks\n\n\n\n",

            "Comparing to see if two objects are not really just one referencing the other: Object.is(). This will tell us if one is really just a variable that was passed a reference to the original object, like with: const var1 = obj1; This is only a reference, so Object.is(var1, obj1) will equal true. If so, the values will always be identical.\n\nComparing unique objects can be a little more involved. There is a loose approach and a more strict approach. \n\nWe can test the number of entries in each, as a different number of entries would indicate they are different. We can do this by checking if one has more keys than the other using Object.keys().length or Object.getOwnPropertyNames().length.\nWhen iterating through the objects, we must also account for the possibility of nested arrays and/or objects. These might even go many levels deep.\n\nOne way is to turn both objects into strings using JSON.stringify() and then compare the strings. This will ONLY work if we know the keys will always be IN THE SAME ORDER. When using this method, any variance, like a key being in a different place, will cause the comparison to fail even though the values might be identical.\n\nA more strict approach is to iterate through each object and check the key-value pair against the other. This will work even if the keys are not in the same order. \n\n\nconst user1 = {\n  first: 'Lando',\n  last: 'Calrissian'\n};\nconst user2 = {\n  first: 'Lando',\n  last: 'Calrissian'\n};\n\n\n// Direct comparison\nconsole.log(user1 === user2);  // false\n\n// Stringify process\nconst stringObj1 = JSON.stringify(user1);\nconst stringObj2 = JSON.stringify(user2);\n\nconsole.log(typeof stringObj1);  // string\nconsole.log(stringObj1 === stringObj2);  // true\n\n\n\n// Iterating process possibiltiy\nfunction isSameObject (obj1, obj2) {\n  const props1 = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj1);\n  const props2 = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj2);\n\n  if (props1.length !== props2.length) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < props1.length; i++) {\n    const property = props1[i];\n\n    if (props1[property] !== props2[property]) {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return true;\n}\n\nconsole.log(isSameObject(user1, user2));  // true",

          answer:
            "A pseudo-element in CSS is similar to a pseudo-class in that it uses a keyword added to a selector, but he similarities end there. CSS pseudo-elements let us style a specific part of elements or even add to the beginning or end of the element. In addition, a pseudo-element will use double colons between the keyword and the selector. Technically, because this double-colon convention was not in place early on, the spec still allows this. That said, it is still expected that double colons are used.\n\n\nA few examples:\n\n::after - This creates an inline pseudo-element as the lst child of an element.\n\n::before - Similar to the above, this creates an inline pseudo-element as the first child of an element.\n\n::first-letter - This will apply styles to the first letter of the first line of an element.\n\n::first-line - This works like ::first-letter, but the style will apply to the whole line. What qualifies for the first line will depend on the width of the element, font size and other similar factors.\n\n::selection - When the user highlights a section, usually by clicking and dragging the mouse across text, we can style this highlighted area using the ::selection pseudo-element.\n\n\nDrop this example into an online editor, like https://codepen.io/pen/, to see a few of the pseudo-elements work their magic:\n\nCSS\n\tp::first-letter {\n\t\tfont-size: 50px;\n\t}\n\n\tp::first-line {\n\t\tcolor: orange;\n\t\tletter-spacing: 0.5em;\n\t}\n\n\tp::before {\n\t\tcontent: 'THIS IS BEFORE ---- ';\n\t\tcolor: darkblue;\n\t\tbackground-color: yellowgreen;\n\t}\n\n\tp::after {\n\t\tcontent: '--- THIS IS AFTER';\n\t\tbackground: gray;\n\t\tcolor: aquamarine;\n\t}\n\n\nHTML\n\t<p>The first line will be orange and have letter-spacing applied. The first line changes as the element size changes. The resat of the line will be black, except for the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements. \n\t</p>\n\n",
